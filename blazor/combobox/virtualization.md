# Virtualization in Blazor ComboBox Component

The ComboBox component includes a virtual scrolling feature designed to enhance UI performance, particularly for handling large datasets. By enabling the [EnableVirtualization](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.DropDowns.SfDropDownList-2.html#Syncfusion_Blazor_DropDowns_SfDropDownList_2_EnableVirtualization) option, the ComboBox intelligently manages data rendering, ensuring only a subset of items is initially loaded when the component is rendered. As you interact with the dropdown, additional items are dynamically loaded as you scroll, creating a smooth and efficient user experience.

This feature is applicable to both local and remote data scenarios, providing flexibility in its implementation. For instance, consider a case where the ComboBox is bound to a dataset containing 150 items. Upon opening the dropdown, only a few items are loaded initially, based on the height of the popup. As you scroll through the list, additional items are fetched and loaded on-demand, allowing you to effortlessly explore the complete dataset.


```cshtml

@using Syncfusion.Blazor.DropDowns
@using Syncfusion.Blazor.Data

<SfComboBox TValue="string" TItem="Record" Placeholder="Select an item" DataSource="@Records" Query="@LocalDataQuery" PopupHeight="130px" EnableVirtualization="true">
    <ComboBoxFieldSettings Text="Text" Value="ID"></ComboBoxFieldSettings>
</SfComboBox>

@code{
    public Query LocalDataQuery = new Query().Take(6); 
    public class Record 
    { 
        public string ID { get; set; } 
        public string Text { get; set; } 
    } 
    public List<Record> Records { get; set; } 
    protected override void OnInitialized()
    { 
        this.Records = Enumerable.Range(1, 150).Select(i => new Record() 
        { 
            ID = i.ToString(), 
            Text = "Item " + i, 
        }).ToList(); 
    } 
}
```

## Keyboard interaction

Users can navigate through the scrollable content using keyboard keys. This feature loads the next or next set of items based on the key inputs in the popup.The ComboBox supports the following keyboard shortcuts.

| Key | Action |
|-----|-----|
| `ArrowDown` | Loads the next virtual list item if the selection is present in last item of the current page. |
| `ArrowUp` | Loads the previous virtual list item if the selection is present in first item of the current page. |
| `PageDown` | Loads the next page and selects the last item in it. |
| `PageUp` | Loads the previous page and selects the first item in it. |

## Limitation of virtualization

* Virtualization is not supported in the grouping feature.
* Selected Value may or may not be present in the current view port.
* Long-pressing of navigation keys is not intended for item navigation in the ComboBox component , It accepts single key action at a time.
