# Form Validation in ComboBox

This article demonstrates how to use the Syncfusion ComboBox within a Blazor EditForm to validate user input with data annotations. The example shows a form where the user selects an item from the ComboBox, and validation ensures required fields are completed before submission.

## ComboBox inside edit form

The ComboBox component can be used inside an EditForm to create a form that includes a list for selecting an option. The `EditForm` component validates all data annotation rules using the `DataAnnotationsValidator` component.

When the ComboBox input is valid, the form is ready to be submitted. If the input is invalid, an error message will be displayed until a valid value is chosen.

- The EditForm component wraps the entire form, sets the Model to a view model (for example, Countries), and invokes a submit handler when the form is submitted.
- The DataAnnotationsValidator component enables validation based on data annotation attributes (such as [Required]) applied to model properties.
- The ValidationSummary component displays a summary of all validation errors in the form.
- The ValidationMessage component displays a validation error message for the specific model property bound to the ComboBox (for example, the Name property).
- The submit button submits the form and invokes the submit handler when clicked.
