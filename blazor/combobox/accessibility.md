# Accessibility in Blazor ComboBox Component

The [Blazor ComboBox](https://www.syncfusion.com/blazor-components/blazor-combobox) component has been designed with the `WAI-ARIA` specifications in mind, and applies the WAI-ARIA roles, states, and properties along with `keyboard support`. This component is characterized
by complete keyboard interaction support and ARIA accessibility support that makes it easy for people who use assistive technologies (AT) or those who completely rely on keyboard navigation.

The Blazor ComboBox component followed the accessibility guidelines and standards, including [ADA](https://www.ada.gov/), [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/), [WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) standards, and [WCAG roles](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#roles) that are commonly used to evaluate accessibility.

The accessibility compliance for the Blazor ComboBox component is outlined below.

## WAI-ARIA attributes

The Blazor ComboBox component uses the `combobox` role, and each list item has an `option` role. The following `ARIA attributes` denotes the ComboBox state:

| **Properties** | **Functionalities** |
| --- | --- |
| `aria-haspopup` | Indicates whether the ComboBox input element has a popup list or not. |
| `aria-expanded` | Indicates whether the popup list has expanded or not. |
| `aria-selected` | Indicates the selected option. |
| `aria-readonly` | Indicates the readonly state of the ComboBox element. |
| `aria-disabled` | Indicates whether the ComboBox component is in a disabled state or not. |
| `aria-activedescendent` | This attribute holds the ID of the active list item to focus its descendant child element. |
| `aria-owns` | This attribute contains the ID of the popup list to indicate popup as a child element. |
| `aria-autocomplete`  | This attribute contains the ‘both’ to a list of options shows and the currently selected suggestion also shows inline. |

## Keyboard interaction

You can use the following key shortcuts to access the Blazor ComboBox without interruptions:

| **Keyboard shortcuts** | **Actions** |
| --- | --- |
|**Focus**|
|<kbd>Alt + J</kbd> | Focuses on the first component of the sample. |
|**Input Navigation**|
| <kbd>Alt + Down arrow</kbd> | Opens the popup list. |
| <kbd>Alt + Up arrow</kbd> | Closes the popup list. |
| <kbd>Home</kbd> |  Cursor moves before the first character in the input. |
| <kbd>End</kbd> |  Cursor moves before the last character in the input. |
| <kbd>Tab</kbd> | Focuses on the next TabIndex element on the page when the popup is closed. Otherwise, closes the popup list and remains the focus of the component. |
| <kbd>Shift + tab </kbd> | Focuses on the previous TabIndex element on the page when the popup is closed. Otherwise, closes the popup list and remains the focus of the component. |
|**Selection**|
| <kbd>Enter</kbd> | Selects the focused item, and when it is in open state, the popup list closes. Otherwise, toggles the popup list. |
|**Popup Navigation**|
| <kbd>Esc(Escape)</kbd> | Closes the popup list when it is in an open state and the currently selected item remains the same. |
| <kbd>Down arrow</kbd> | Selects the first item in the ComboBox when no item is selected. Otherwise, selects the item next to the currently selected item. |
| <kbd>Up arrow</kbd> | Selects the item previous to the currently selected one. |
| <kbd>Page down</kbd> | Scrolls down to the next page and selects the first item when the popup list opens. |
| <kbd>Page up</kbd> | Scrolls up to the previous page and selects the first item when the popup list opens. |

N> In the following sample, disable the ComboBox component using <kbd>t</kbd> keys.

```cshtml
@using Syncfusion.Blazor.DropDowns

<SfComboBox TValue="string" TItem="Country" @ref="ComboObj" Enabled="@enable" Placeholder="Select a country" @onkeypress="@(e => KeyPressed(e))" DataSource="@LocalData">
    <ComboBoxFieldSettings Value="Code" Text="Name"></ComboBoxFieldSettings>
</SfComboBox>

@code {

    public SfComboBox<string, Country> ComboObj;

    public bool enable { get; set; } = true;
    public class Country
    {
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public string Code { get; set; }
    }

    List<Country> LocalData = new List<Country> {
        new Country() { Name = "Australia", Code = "AU" },
        new Country() { Name = "Bermuda", Code = "BM" },
        new Country() { Name = "Canada", Code = "CA" },
        new Country() { Name = "Cameroon", Code = "CM" },
        new Country() { Name = "Denmark", Code = "DK" },
        new Country() { Name = "France", Code = "FR" },
        new Country() { Name = "Finland", Code = "FI" },
        new Country() { Name = "Germany", Code = "DE" },
        new Country() { Name = "Greenland", Code = "GL" },
        new Country() { Name = "Hong Kong", Code = "HK" },
    };

    public void KeyPressed(KeyboardEventArgs args)
    {
        if (args.Key == "t")
        {
            enable = false;
        }
    }
}

## Ensuring accessibility

The Blazor ComboBox component's accessibility levels are ensured through an [axe-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axe-core) software tool during automated testing.

The accessibility compliance of the ComboBox component is shown in the following sample. Open the [sample](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/accessibility/combobox) in a new window to evaluate the accessibility of the ComboBox component with accessibility tools.
