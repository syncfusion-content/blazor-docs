# Handwritten Signature in Blazor SfPdfViewer Component

The handwritten signature can be added to the PDF document using the annotation toolbar.

* Click the **Edit Annotation** button in the SfPdfViewer toolbar. A toolbar appears below it.
* Select the **HandWritten Signature** button in the annotation toolbar. The signature panel will appear.
