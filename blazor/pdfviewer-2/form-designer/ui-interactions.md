### Dragging Form Fields: 

Users can drag form fields to reposition them anywhere within the document. By clicking and holding a form field, users can move it to the desired location, and alignment guides may appear to help ensure precise placement before releasing the field.

### Editing or Updating Form Fields: 

Form fields can be edited dynamically using the Form Field Properties window. This window can be accessed by selecting the Properties option from the context menu that appears when right-clicking a form field. Users can customize various properties, such as the field name, placeholder text, value, and styles, to modify the appearance and behavior of the form field.

### Form Field Operations

Users can efficiently manage form fields using various operations such as copy, cut, paste, undo, and redo. Form fields can be duplicated using the Copy (Ctrl + C) command, moved to a different location using Cut (Ctrl + X), and inserted elsewhere with Paste (Ctrl + V).

Additionally, users can revert the last change using Undo (Ctrl + Z) or restore an undone action with Redo (Ctrl + Y), ensuring smooth workflow adjustments.
