# Overview of Blazor SfPdfViewer Component

The new Blazor SfPdfViewer component allows users to view, edit, print, and download PDF files without the web service dependency in Blazor applications. It is designed to be fast and responsive and comes with the same feature set as the previous PDF Viewer. It is easy to use and can be integrated into both Blazor Server and WASM applications with minimal effort.

The Blazor SfPdfViewer component shares the same key features as the [Blazor PDF Viewer component](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/pdfviewer/getting-started/features), but this new component has some advantages over the old component.

## Performance Improvement

We have enhanced the performance in rendering, scrolling, zooming, panning, and printing.â€¯ 

## Elimination of Service Dependency

The old PDF viewer component required a separate [Service URL](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/pdfviewer/getting-started/web-assembly-application) to load the document. However, in the [NextGen PDF Viewer](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/pdfviewer-2/getting-started/web-assembly-application), we have eliminated the need for a service URL. Now, the document can be loaded offline without making a service call. 

## Common Package

In the previous component, we had different packages for different operating systems such as [Windows](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Syncfusion.Blazor.PdfViewerServer.Windows), [Linux](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Syncfusion.Blazor.PdfViewerServer.Linux), and [OSX](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Syncfusion.Blazor.PdfViewerServer.OSX). In the [NextGen](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Syncfusion.Blazor.SfPdfViewer) version, we have introduced common packages that work across all environments. 

## Reduced Server Calls

The old PDF viewer component required numerous C# calls to retrieve document information such as text on the page, hyperlinks, and page images. In the NextGen PDF Viewer, we have shifted these functionalities to the client side, resulting in improved performance. 

## Some of the key features are listed below

* Accurate and reliable rendering of PDF pages.

    * [Thumbnail page view](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/pdfviewer-2/navigation#page-thumbnail-navigation)
