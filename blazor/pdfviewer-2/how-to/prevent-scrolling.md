# Prevent the PDF from scrolling and remove the vertical scrollbar

To prevent a PDF from scrolling and remove the vertical scroll bar in the Syncfusion Blazor SfPdfViewer component, use CSS to set the `overflow` property of the component container to `hidden`.

By setting the overflow property to hidden, the SfPdfViewer component will be displayed without a vertical scrollbar, and the user will not be able to scroll the content of a PDF.

```html

<style>
    .e-pv-viewer-container {
        overflow: hidden !important;
    }
</style>

```
