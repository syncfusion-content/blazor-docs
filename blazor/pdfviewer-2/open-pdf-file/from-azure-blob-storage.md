# Open PDF file from Azure Blob Storage 

To load a PDF file from Azure Blob Storage  in a SfPdfViewer, you can follow the steps below

**Step 1:** Create the Azure Blob Storage account

Log in to the Azure Portal. Create a new Storage Account with preferred settings. Note access keys during the setup. Within the Storage Account, create a Blob Container following the steps in this [link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create?toc=%2Fazure%2Fstorage%2Fblobs%2Ftoc.json&tabs=azure-portal).

**Step 2:** Create a Simple SfPdfViewer Sample in blazor

Start by following the steps provided in this [link](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/pdfviewer-2/getting-started/server-side-application) to create a simple SfPdfViewer sample in blazor. This will give you a basic setup of the SfPdfViewer component.

**Step 3:** Include the following namespaces in the **Index.razor** file.

1. Import the required namespaces at the top of the file:

```csharp
@using System.IO;
@using Azure.Storage.Blobs;
@using Azure.Storage.Blobs.Specialized;
@using Syncfusion.Blazor.SfPdfViewer;
```

**Step 4:** Add the below code example to load a PDF from `Azure blob storage` container.

```csharp

@page "/"

<SfPdfViewer2 DocumentPath="@DocumentPath"
              Height="100%"
              Width="100%">
</SfPdfViewer2>

@code {
    private string DocumentPath { get; set; }

    private readonly string connectionString = "Your Connection string from Azure";
    private readonly string containerName = "Your container name in Azure";
    private readonly string fileName = "File Name to be loaded into Syncfusion SfPdfViewer";
	
    protected override void OnInitialized()
    {
        //Connection String of Storage Account
        BlobServiceClient blobServiceClient = new BlobServiceClient(connectionString);
        BlobContainerClient blobContainerClient = blobServiceClient.GetBlobContainerClient(containerName);
        BlockBlobClient blockBlobClient = blobContainerClient.GetBlockBlobClient(fileName);
        MemoryStream memoryStream = new MemoryStream();
        blockBlobClient.DownloadTo(memoryStream);
        DocumentPath = "data:application/pdf;base64," + Convert.ToBase64String(memoryStream.ToArray());
    }
}
```

N> Replace **Your Connection string from Azure** with the actual connection string for your Azure Blob Storage account, **File Name to be Loaded into Syncfusion SfPdfViewer** with the file name to load from the Azure container to the SfPdfViewer, and **Your container name in Azure** with the actual container name.

N> The **Azure.Storage.Blobs** NuGet package must be installed in your application to use the previous code example.
