# Accessibility in Blazor Toast Component

The [Blazor Toast](https://www.syncfusion.com/blazor-components/blazor-toast) component has been designed with [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/practices/) specifications in mind by applying the prompt WAI-ARIA roles, states, and properties with the keyboard support. It helps users who use assistive WAI-ARIA accessibility support, which is achieved using attributes.

It provides information about the elements in a document for assistive technology.

The Blazor Toast component implements the keyboard navigation support by using the following [WAI-ARIA practices](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/practices/) and is tested in major screen readers.

The Blazor Toast component followed the accessibility guidelines and standards, including [ADA](https://www.ada.gov/), [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/), [WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) standards, and [WCAG roles](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#roles) that are commonly used to evaluate accessibility.
