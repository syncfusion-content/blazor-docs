# Accessibility in Blazor Accumulation Chart Component

Accessibility is achieved in the accumulation chart component through WAI-ARIA standard. The accumulation chart features can be effectively accessed through assistive technologies such as screen readers.

## WAI-ARIA

WAI-ARIA(Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications) defines a way to increase the accessibility of web pages, dynamic content, and user interface components developed with AJAX, HTML, Javascript, and related technologies. ARIA provides additional semantics to describe the role, state, and functionality of web components.

-----|-----
Datalabel |Reads the Point y value.
Legend |Click to show or hide the series.
Axis Title |Reads the axis title.
Chart Title |Reads the chart title.
Series Points |Reads the Point x: Point y value.
