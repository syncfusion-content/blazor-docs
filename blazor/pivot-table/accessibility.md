## WAI-ARIA attributes

The pivot table component followed the [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/table/) patterns to meet the accessibility. The following ARIA attributes are used in the pivot table component:

| Attributes | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `role=grid` | Attribute added to identify the grid component element within the pivot table element. |
| `role=region` | Attribute added to identify the chart component element within the pivot table element. |
| `role=button` | This attribute is added to the pager navigation buttons as well as the buttons in the dialog popup such as field list, calculated field, member editor, conditional formatting of pivot table component to indicate that it is a clickable element. |
| `role=table` | This attribute is added to each conditional formatting style container element to denote it as a table. |
| `role=tableItems` | This attribute is added to the container element that appears inside the number formatting popup to indicate it as a table. |
| `aria-disabled` | The buttons within the dialog popups, such as field list, calculated field and member editor, will be disabled based on their usability. To indicate its disabled state, we will add this attribute with the values `true`. By default, the attribute value is set to `false`. |
| `aria-label` | This attribute is added to label elements that are placed inside the pager, member editor popup, and calculated field popup to identify them as label elements. |

## Keyboard Navigation

The pivot table component followed the [keyboard interaction](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/alert/#keyboardinteraction) guideline, making it easy for people who use assistive technologies (AT) and those who completely rely on keyboard navigation. The following keyboard shortcuts are supported by the pivot table component.

### Pivot Table

| **Windows** | **To do this** |
| -----|----- |
| <kbd>Tab</kbd> | Moves the cell focus right side. If no cells are focused, it moves to the next active element in the browser page. |
| <kbd>Shift + Tab</kbd> | Moves the cell focus left side. If no cells are focused, it moves to the previous active element in the browser page. |
| <kbd>DownArrow</kbd> | Moves the cell focus downwards. If the selection is enabled in the pivot table, then it will move downwards to select next row or column or individual cell. |
| <kbd>UpArrow</kbd> | Moves the cell focus upwards. If the selection is enabled in the pivot table, then it will move upwards to select previous row or column or individual cell. |
| <kbd>LeftArrow</kbd> | Moves the cell focus left side. If the selection is enabled in the pivot table, then it will move left side to select previous row or column or individual cell. |
| <kbd>RightArrow</kbd> | Moves the cell focus right side. If the selection is enabled in the pivot table, then it will move right side to select next row or column or individual cell. |
| <kbd>Shift + DownArrow</kbd> | Extends the cell selection downwards. |
| <kbd>Shift + UpArrow</kbd> | Extends the cell selection selection upwards. |
| <kbd>Shift + LeftArrow</kbd> | Extends the cell selection to the left side. |
| <kbd>Shift + RightArrow</kbd> | Extends the cell selection to the right side. |
| <kbd>Ctrl + A</kbd> | Selects all cells. |
