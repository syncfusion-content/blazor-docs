# Accessibility in Blazor Pivot Table Component

Accessibility is achieved in the pivot table component through WAI-ARIA standard and keyboard navigation. The pivot table features can be effectively accessed through assistive technologies such as screen readers.

## WAI-ARIA

WAI-ARIA (Accessibility Initiative â€“ Accessible Rich Internet Applications) defines a way to increase the accessibility of web pages, dynamic content, and user interface components developed with Ajax, HTML, JavaScript,and related technologies. ARIA provides additional semantics to describe the role, state, and functionality of web components.

The following ARIA attributes are used in the pivot table:

* grid (role)
* row (role)
* gridcell (role)
* aria-selected (attribute)
* aria-expanded (attribute)
* aria-sort (attribute)
* aria-busy (attribute)
* aria-invalid (attribute)
* aria-grabbed (attribute)
* aria-owns (attribute)
* aria-label (attribute)

## Keyboard Navigation

All the pivot table actions can be controlled via keyboard keys. The applicable key combinations and their relative functionalities are listed below for the appropriate UI features available in the component.

### Pivot Table

Interaction Keys |Description
-----|-----
<kbd>Tab</kbd> |Moves the cell focus right side. If no cells are focused, it moves to the next active element in the browser page.
<kbd>Shift + Tab</kbd> |Moves the cell focus left side. If no cells are focused, it moves to the previous active element in the browser page.
<kbd>DownArrow</kbd> |Moves the cell focus downwards. If the selection is enabled in the pivot table, then it will move downwards to select next row or column or individual cell.
<kbd>UpArrow</kbd> |Moves the cell focus upwards. If the selection is enabled in the pivot table, then it will move upwards to select previous row or column or individual cell.
<kbd>LeftArrow</kbd> |Moves the cell focus left side. If the selection is enabled in the pivot table, then it will move left side to select previous row or column or individual cell.
<kbd>RightArrow</kbd> |Moves the cell focus right side. If the selection is enabled in the pivot table, then it will move right side to select next row or column or individual cell.
<kbd>Shift + DownArrow</kbd> |Extends the cell selection downwards.
<kbd>Shift + UpArrow</kbd> |Extends the cell selection selection upwards.
<kbd>Shift + LeftArrow</kbd> |Extends the cell selection to the left side.
<kbd>Shift + RightArrow</kbd> |Extends the cell selection to the right side.
