# Overview of Blazor Pivot Table

The Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> Blazor Pivot Table provides interactive tools for summarizing, organizing, exploring, and presenting multidimensional data. Use the following feature overview to identify the available capabilities, understand where they apply, and open the corresponding user guide topic for configuration details and limitations.

For supported Blazor and browser versions, refer to the [system requirements](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/system-requirements).

## Common use cases

* **Interactive business analysis** - Reorganize fields, filter members, drill into hierarchies, and compare aggregated values from different perspectives.
* **Operational and financial reporting** - Create summarized reports with calculated fields, conditional formatting, totals, and reusable report layouts.
* **Large dataset exploration** - Use virtual scrolling, paging, data compression, or server-side processing to analyze high-volume data.
* **Multidimensional analysis** - Connect to OLAP cubes and SSAS data sources to explore measures, dimensions, and hierarchies.
* **Visual reporting** - Present summarized data through Pivot Charts and export or print the resulting reports.

## Feature overview

The **Availability** column uses the following terms:

* **Built-in** - Works automatically when the relevant view or data structure is present, without a feature-specific property or module.
* **Configurable** - Requires feature-specific component properties, injected modules, server endpoints, or services.
* **Integration pattern** - Implemented by integrating the Pivot Table with another component or service; it is not a standalone Pivot Table feature.
* **Partial** - Qualifies standards conformance rather than the delivery method and indicates documented conformance gaps or limitations.

> Feature behavior can differ between relational and OLAP data sources. Review the linked topic before combining features because some options are mutually exclusive or have data-source-specific limitations. For example, virtual scrolling and paging cannot be enabled at the same time.
