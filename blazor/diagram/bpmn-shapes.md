# Shapes

BPMN shapes are used to represent the internal business procedure in a graphical notation and enable you to communicate the procedures in a standard manner. To create a BPMN shape, in the node property shape, type should be set as “Bpmn” and its shape should be set as any one of the built-in shapes. The following code example illustrates how to create a simple business process.

```csharp
@using Syncfusion.Blazor.Diagrams
@using System.Collections.ObjectModel

@* Initialize Diagram *@
<SfDiagram Width="500px" Height="@Height" Nodes="@NodeCollection">
</SfDiagram>

@code{
    public string Height { get; set; } = "700px";
    //Initialize node collection with Node
    ObservableCollection<DiagramNode> NodeCollection = new ObservableCollection<DiagramNode>()
    {
        new DiagramNode()
        {
            // Position of the node
            OffsetX = 100,
            OffsetY = 100,
            // Size of the node
            Width = 100,
            Height = 100,
            // Unique Id of the node
            Id = "node1",
            //Sets type as Bpmn and shape as Event
            Shape = new DiagramShape()
            {
                Type = Shapes.Bpmn,
                BpmnShape=BpmnShapes.Event,
                // set the event type as End
                Event = new DiagramBpmnEvent() { Event = BpmnEvents.End }
            }
        }
    };
}
```

>Note : The default value for the property [`Shape`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.Diagrams.DiagramNode.html#Syncfusion_Blazor_Diagrams_DiagramNode_Shape) is “event”.

The list of BPMN shapes are as follows:

| Shape | Image |
| -------- | -------- |
| Event | ![Event Shape](images/Event.png) |
| Gateway | ![Gateway Shape](images/Gateway.png) |
| Task | ![Task Shape](images/Task.png) |
| Message | ![Message Shape](images/Message.png) |
| DataSource | ![Datasource Shape](images/Datasource.png) |
| DataObject | ![Dataobject Shape](images/Dataobject.png) |
| Group | ![Group Shape](images/Group.png) |

The BPMN shapes and its types are explained as follows.

## Event

An [`Event`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.Diagrams.DiagramBpmnEvent.html#Syncfusion_Blazor_Diagrams_DiagramBpmnEvent_Event) is notated with a circle and it represents an event in a business process. The type of events are as follows:

    * Start
    * End
    * Intermediate
The event property of the node allows you to define the type of the event. The default value of the event is **start**. The following code example illustrates how to create a BPMN event.

```csharp
@using Syncfusion.Blazor.Diagrams
@using System.Collections.ObjectModel

@* Initialize Diagram *@
<SfDiagram Width="500px" Height="@Height" Nodes="@NodeCollection">
</SfDiagram>

@code{
    public string Height { get; set; } = "500px";
    //Initialize node collection with node
    ObservableCollection<DiagramNode> NodeCollection = new ObservableCollection<DiagramNode>()
    {
        new DiagramNode()
        {
            //Position of the node
            OffsetX = 100,
            OffsetY = 100,
            //Size of the node
            Width = 100,
            Height = 100,
            //Unique Id of the node
            Id = "node1",
            //Sets type as Bpmn and shape as event
            Shape = new DiagramShape()
            {
                Type = Shapes.Bpmn,
                BpmnShape=BpmnShapes.Event,
                // set the event type as End
                Event = new DiagramBpmnEvent() { Event = BpmnEvents.End }
            }
        }
    };
}
```

Event triggers are notated as icons inside the circle and they represent the specific details of the process. The `Trigger` property of the node allows you to set the type of trigger and by default, it is set as **None**. The following table illustrates the type of event triggers.

| Triggers | Start | Non-Interrupting Start | Intermediate | Non-Interrupting Intermediate | Throwing Intermediate | End |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| None | ![None Trigger Start event BPMN Shape](images/None1.png)  | ![None Trigger Interupting event BPMN Shape](images/None2.png) | ![None Trigger Intermediate event  BPMN Shape](images/None3.png) | ![None Trigger NonInteruptingIntermediate BPMNShape](images/None4.png) | | ![None Trigger End event  event  BPMNShape](images/None5.png) |

## Gateway

Gateway is used to control the flow of a process and it is represented as a diamond shape. To create a gateway, the shape property of the node should be set as “Gateway” and the [`Gateway`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.Diagrams.DiagramBpmnGateway.html) property can be set with any of the appropriate gateways. The following code example illustrates how to create a BPMN Gateway.

```csharp
@using Syncfusion.Blazor.Diagrams
@using System.Collections.ObjectModel

@* Initialize Diagram *@
<SfDiagram Width="500px" Height="@Height" Nodes="@NodeCollection">
</SfDiagram>

@code{
     public string Height { get; set; } = "500px";
    //Initialize node collection with node
    ObservableCollection<DiagramNode> NodeCollection = new ObservableCollection<DiagramNode>()
    {
        new DiagramNode()
        {
            //Position of the node
            OffsetX = 100,
            OffsetY = 100,
            //Size of the node
            Width = 100,
            Height = 100,
            //Unique Id of the node
            Id = "node1",
            //Sets type as Bpmn and shape as Gateway
            Shape = new DiagramShape()
            {
                Type = Shapes.Bpmn,
                BpmnShape=BpmnShapes.Gateway,
                //Sets type of the gateway as None
                Gateway=new DiagramBpmnGateway(){Type=BpmnGateways.None},
                //set the event type as End
                Event = new DiagramBpmnEvent() { Event = BpmnEvents.End }
            }
        }
    };
}

```

>Note: By default, the `Gateway` will be set as **None**.

There are several types of gateways as tabulated:

| Shape | Image |
| -------- | -------- |
| Exclusive | ![Exclusive GateWay BPMN Shape](images/Exclusive.png) |
| Parallel | ![Parallel GateWay BPMN Shape](images/Parallel.png) |
| Inclusive | ![Inclusive GateWay BPMN Shape](images/Inclusive.png) |
| Complex | ![Complex GateWay BPMN Shape](images/Complex.png) |
| EventBased | ![EventBased GateWay BPMNShape](images/EventBased.png) |
| ExclusiveEventBased | ![Exclusive EventBased GateWay BPMN Shape](images/EEBased.png) |
| ParallelEventBased | ![Parallel EventBased GateWay BPMN Shape](images/PEBased.png) |

## Activity

The [`Activity`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.Diagrams.DiagramBpmnActivity.html) is the task that is performed in a business process. It is represented by a rounded rectangle.

There are two types of activities. They are listed as follows:

* Task: Occurs within a process and it is not broken down to a finer level of detail.
* Subprocess: Occurs within a process and it is broken down to a finer level of detail.

To create a BPMN activity, set the `Shape` as **Activity**. You also need to set the type of the BPMN activity by using the `Activity` property of the node. By default, the type of the activity is set as **Task**. The following code example illustrates how to create an activity.

```csharp
@using Syncfusion.Blazor.Diagrams
@using System.Collections.ObjectModel

@* Initialize Diagram *@
<SfDiagram Width="500px" Height="@Height" Nodes="@NodeCollection">
</SfDiagram>

@code{
    public string Height { get; set; } = "500px";
    //Initialize node collection with node
    ObservableCollection<DiagramNode> NodeCollection = new ObservableCollection<DiagramNode>()
    {
        new DiagramNode()
        {
            //Position of the node
            OffsetX = 100,
            OffsetY = 100,
            //Size of the node
            Width = 100,
            Height = 100,
            //Unique id of the node
            Id = "node1",
            //sets the type of shape as Bpmn and shape as activity
            Shape = new DiagramShape()
            {
                Type = Shapes.Bpmn,
                BpmnShape=BpmnShapes.Activity,
                //Sets the activity type as task
                Activity=new DiagramBpmnActivity(){Activity=BpmnActivities.Task},
            }
        }
    };
}

```

## Tasks

The [`Task`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.Diagrams.DiagramBpmnTask.html) property of the node allows you to define the type of task such as sending, receiving, user-based task, etc. By default, the `Type` property of task is set as **None**. The following code illustrates how to create different types of
BPMN tasks.
The events property of tasks allows to represent these results as an event attached to the task.

```csharp
@using Syncfusion.Blazor.Diagrams
@using System.Collections.ObjectModel

@* Initialize Diagram *@
<SfDiagram Width="500px" Height="@Height" Nodes="@NodeCollection">
</SfDiagram>

@code{
    public string Height { get; set; } = "500px";
    //Initialize node collection with node
    ObservableCollection<DiagramNode> NodeCollection = new ObservableCollection<DiagramNode>()
    {
        new DiagramNode()
        {
            //Position of the node
            OffsetX = 100,
            OffsetY = 100,
            //Size of the node
            Width = 100,
            Height = 100,
            //Unique id of the node
            Id = "node1",
            //Sets the type as bpmn and shape as activity
            Shape = new DiagramShape()
            {
                Type = Shapes.Bpmn,
                BpmnShape=BpmnShapes.Activity,
                //Sets activity as Task
                Activity=new DiagramBpmnActivity()
                {
                    Activity=BpmnActivities.Task,
                    //Sets the type of the task as Send
                    Task=new DiagramBpmnTask(){ Type=BpmnTasks.Send }
                },
            }
        }
    };
}
```

The various types of BPMN tasks are tabulated as follows.

| Shape | Image |
| -------- | -------- |
| Service | ![Service Task BPMN Shape](images/Service.png) |
| Send | ![Send Task BPMN Shape](images/Send.png) |
| Receive | ![Receive Task BPMN Shape](images/Receive.png) |
| Instantiating Receive | ![Instantiating Receive Task BPMN Shape](images/InsService.png) |
| Manual |![Manual Task BPMN Shape](images/Manual.png) |
| Business Rule | ![Business Rule  Task BPMN Shape](images/Bussiness.png) |
| User | ![User Task BPMN Shape](images/User.png) |
| Script | ![Script Task BPMN Shape](images/Script.png) |

## Subprocess

A [`Sub-process`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.Diagrams.DiagramBpmnSubProcess.html) is a group of tasks, which is used to hide or reveal details of additional levels using the `Collapsed` property.

```csharp
@using Syncfusion.Blazor.Diagrams
@using System.Collections.ObjectModel

@* Initialize Diagram *@
<SfDiagram Width="500px" Height="@Height" Nodes="@NodeCollection">
</SfDiagram>

@code{
    public string Height { get; set; } = "500px";
    //Initialize node collection with node
    ObservableCollection<DiagramNode> NodeCollection = new ObservableCollection<DiagramNode>()
    {
        new DiagramNode()
        {
            //Position of the node
            OffsetX = 100,
            OffsetY = 100,
            //Size of the node
            Width = 100,
            Height = 100,
            //Unique id of the node
            Id = "node1",
            //Sets type as Bpmn and shape as Activity
            Shape = new DiagramShape()
            {
                Type = Shapes.Bpmn,
                BpmnShape=BpmnShapes.Activity,
                //Sets activity as subprocess and collapsed of subprocess as true
                Activity=new DiagramBpmnActivity()
                {
                    Activity=BpmnActivities.SubProcess,
                    SubProcess=new DiagramBpmnSubProcess(){ Collapsed=true}
                },
            }
        }
    };
}
```

The different types of subprocess are as follows:

    * Event subprocess
    * Transaction

## Event SubProcess

A [`SubProcess`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.Diagrams.DiagramBpmnSubProcess.html) is defined as an event SubProcess, when it is triggered by an event. An event SubProcess is placed within another subprocess which part of the normal flow of its parent process is not. You can set event to a subprocess with the `Event` and `Trigger` property of the subprocess. The `Type` property of subprocess allows you to define the type of subprocess whether it should be event subprocess or transaction subprocess.

```csharp
@using Syncfusion.Blazor.Diagrams
@using System.Collections.ObjectModel

@* Initialize Diagram *@
<SfDiagram Width="500px" Height="@Height" Nodes="@NodeCollection">
</SfDiagram>

@code{
     public string Height { get; set; } = "500px";
     //Initialize node collection with node
     ObservableCollection<DiagramNode> NodeCollection = new ObservableCollection<DiagramNode>()
     {
        new DiagramNode()
        {
            // Position of the node
            OffsetX = 100,
            OffsetY = 100,
            // Size of the node
            Width = 100,
            Height = 100,
            // Unique id of the node
            Id = "node1",
            // Sets the type as Bpmn and shape as Activity
            Shape = new DiagramShape()
            {
                Type = Shapes.Bpmn,
                BpmnShape=BpmnShapes.Activity,
                //Sets activity as SubProcess
                Activity=new DiagramBpmnActivity()
                {
                    Activity=BpmnActivities.SubProcess,
                    //Sets the collapsed as true and type as Event
                    SubProcess=new DiagramBpmnSubProcess()
                    {
                        Collapsed=true,
                        Type=BpmnSubProcessTypes.Event,
                        //Sets event as Start and trigger as Message
                        Events=new ObservableCollection<DiagramBpmnSubEvent>()
                        {
                            new DiagramBpmnSubEvent()
                            {
                                Event=BpmnEvents.Start,
                                Trigger=BpmnTriggers.Message
                            }
                        }
                    },
                }
            }
        }
    };
}
```

## Transaction subprocess

* [`Transaction`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.Diagrams.DiagramBpmnSubProcess.html#Syncfusion_Blazor_Diagrams_DiagramBpmnSubProcess_Transaction) is a set of activities that logically belong together, in which all contained activities must complete their parts of the transaction; otherwise the process is undone. The execution result of a transaction is one of Successful Completion, Unsuccessful Completion (Cancel), and Hazard (Exception). The `Events` property of subprocess allows to represent these results as an event attached to the subprocess.

* The event object allows you to define the type of event by which the subprocess will be triggered. The name of the event can be defined to identify the event at runtime.

* The event’s offset property is used to set the fraction/ratio (relative to parent) that defines the position of the event shape.

* The trigger property defines the type of the event trigger.

* You can also use define ports and labels to subprocess events by using event’s ports and labels properties.

                            Failure=new FailureSubEvent(){Offset=new BpmnSubEventOffset(){X=0.75,Y=1}}
                        }
                    },
                }
            }
        }
    };
}
```

## Process

[`Processes`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.Diagrams.DiagramBpmnSubProcess.html#Syncfusion_Blazor_Diagrams_DiagramBpmnSubProcess_Processes) is an array collection that defines the children values for BPMN subprocess.

## Loop

[`Loop`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.Diagrams.DiagramBpmnSubProcess.html#Syncfusion_Blazor_Diagrams_DiagramBpmnSubProcess_Loop) is a task that is internally being looped. The loop property of task allows you to define the type of loop. The default value for `Loop` is **None**.
You can define the loop property in subprocess BPMN shape as shown in the following code.

```csharp
@using Syncfusion.Blazor.Diagrams
@using System.Collections.ObjectModel

@* Initialize Diagram *@
<SfDiagram Width="500px" Height="@Height" Nodes="@NodeCollection">
</SfDiagram>

@code{
    public string Height { get; set; } = "500px";
    //Initialize node collection with node
    ObservableCollection<DiagramNode> NodeCollection = new ObservableCollection<DiagramNode>()
    {
        new DiagramNode()
        {
            //Position of the node
            OffsetX = 100,
            OffsetY = 100,
            //Size of the node
            Width = 100,
            Height = 100,
            //Unique id of the node
            Id = "node1",
            //Defines the type as BPMN and shape as activity
            Shape = new DiagramShape()
            {
                Type = Shapes.Bpmn,
                BpmnShape=BpmnShapes.Activity,
                //Set the activity as subprocess
                Activity=new DiagramBpmnActivity()
                {
                    Activity=BpmnActivities.SubProcess,
                    //Sets collapsed as true and loop as standard
                    SubProcess=new DiagramBpmnSubProcess()
                    {
                        Collapsed=true,
                        Loop=BpmnLoops.Standard,
                    },
                }
            }
        }
    };
}
```

The following table contains various types of BPMN loops.

| Loops | Task | Subprocess |
| -------- | -------- | --------|
| Standard | ![Standard Task BPMN Shape](images/Standard1.png)  | ![Standard Subprocess BPMN Shape](images/Standard2.png) |
| SequenceMultiInstance | ![Sequence MultiInstance Task BPMN Shape](images/Sequence1.png) |  ![SequenceMultiInstance Subprocess BPMN Shape](images/Sequence2.png)|
| ParallelMultiInstance | ![ParallelMultiInstance Task BPMNShape](images/PMultiInstance1.png) | ![ParallelMultiInstance Subprocess BPMN Shape](images/PMultiInstance2.png) |

## Compensation

[`Compensation`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.Diagrams.DiagramBpmnSubProcess.html#Syncfusion_Blazor_Diagrams_DiagramBpmnSubProcess_Compensation) is triggered, when operation is partially failed and enabled it with the compensation property of the task and the subprocess.

```csharp
@using Syncfusion.Blazor.Diagrams
@using System.Collections.ObjectModel

@* Initialize Diagram *@
<SfDiagram Width="500px" Height="@Height" Nodes="@NodeCollection">
</SfDiagram>

@code{
    public string Height { get; set; } = "500px";
    //Initialize node collection with node
    ObservableCollection<DiagramNode> NodeCollection = new ObservableCollection<DiagramNode>()
    {
        new DiagramNode()
        {
            //Position of the node
            OffsetX = 100,
            OffsetY = 100,
            //Size of the node
            Width = 100,
            Height = 100,
            //Unique id of the node
            Id = "node1",
            //Defines the type as BPMN and shape as activity
            Shape = new DiagramShape()
            {
                Type = Shapes.Bpmn,
                BpmnShape=BpmnShapes.Activity,
                //Set the activity as task
                Activity=new DiagramBpmnActivity()
                {
                    Activity=BpmnActivities.Task,
                    //set compensation as true
                    Task=new DiagramBpmnTask()
                    {
                        Compensation=true,
                    },
                }
            }
        },

        new DiagramNode()
        {
            //Position of the node
            OffsetX = 300,
            OffsetY = 100,
            //Size of the node
            Width = 100,
            Height = 100,
            //Unique id of the node
            Id = "node1",
           //Defines the type as BPMN and shape as activity
            Shape = new DiagramShape()
            {
                Type = Shapes.Bpmn,
                BpmnShape=BpmnShapes.Activity,
                //Set the activity as SubProcess
                Activity=new DiagramBpmnActivity()
                {
                    Activity=BpmnActivities.SubProcess,
                    //Sets collapsed and compensation as true
                    SubProcess=new DiagramBpmnSubProcess()
                    {
                        Collapsed=true,
                        Compensation=true,
                    },
                }
            }
        }
    };
}
```

## Call

A [`Call`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.Diagrams.DiagramBpmnTask.html#Syncfusion_Blazor_Diagrams_DiagramBpmnTask_Call) activity is a global subprocess that is reused at various points of the business flow and set it with the call property of the task.

```csharp
@using Syncfusion.Blazor.Diagrams
@using System.Collections.ObjectModel

@* Initialize Diagram *@
<SfDiagram Width="500px" Height="@Height" Nodes="@NodeCollection">
</SfDiagram>

@code{  
    public string Height { get; set; } = "500px";
    //Initialize node collection with node
    ObservableCollection<DiagramNode> NodeCollection = new ObservableCollection<DiagramNode>()
    {
        new DiagramNode()
        {
            //Position of the node
            OffsetX = 100,
            OffsetY = 100,
            //Size of the node
            Width = 100,
            Height = 100,
            //Unique id of the node
            Id = "node1",
            //Defines the type as BPMN and shape as activity
            Shape = new DiagramShape()
            {
                Type = Shapes.Bpmn,
                BpmnShape=BpmnShapes.Activity,
                //sets the activity as task
                Activity=new DiagramBpmnActivity()
                {
                    Activity=BpmnActivities.Task,
                    //Sets call as true
                    Task=new DiagramBpmnTask()
                    {
                        Call=true,
                    },
                }
            }
        },
    };
}

```

## Ad-Hoc

An ad-hoc subprocess is a group of tasks that are executed in any order or skipped in order to fulfill the end condition and set it with the [`Ad-hoc`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.Diagrams.DiagramBpmnSubProcess.html#Syncfusion_Blazor_Diagrams_DiagramBpmnSubProcess_Adhoc) property of subprocess.

```csharp
@using Syncfusion.Blazor.Diagrams
@using System.Collections.ObjectModel

@* Initialize Diagram *@
<SfDiagram Width="500px" Height="@Height" Nodes="@NodeCollection">
</SfDiagram>

@code
{
    public string Height { get; set; } = "500px";
    //Initialize node collection with node
    ObservableCollection<DiagramNode> NodeCollection = new ObservableCollection<DiagramNode>()
    {
        new DiagramNode()
        {
            //Position of the node
            OffsetX = 100,
            OffsetY = 100,
            //Size of the node
            Width = 100,
            Height = 100,
            //unique id of the node
            Id = "node1",
           //Defines the type as BPMN and shape as activity
            Shape = new DiagramShape()
            {
                Type = Shapes.Bpmn,
                BpmnShape=BpmnShapes.Activity,
                //Sets the activity as subprocess
                Activity=new DiagramBpmnActivity()
                {
                    Activity=BpmnActivities.SubProcess,
                    //sets collapsed and ad hoc as true
                    SubProcess=new DiagramBpmnSubProcess()
                    {
                        Collapsed=true,
                        Adhoc=true
                    },
                }
            }
        },
    };
}
```

## Boundary

Boundary represents the type of task that is being processed. The [`Boundary`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.Diagrams.DiagramBpmnSubProcess.html#Syncfusion_Blazor_Diagrams_DiagramBpmnSubProcess_Boundary) property of subprocess allows you to define the type of boundary. By default, it is set as **Default**.

```csharp
@using Syncfusion.Blazor.Diagrams
@using System.Collections.ObjectModel

@* Initialize Diagram *@
<SfDiagram Width="500px" Height="@Height" Nodes="@NodeCollection">
</SfDiagram>

@code{
    public string Height { get; set; } = "500px";
    //Initialize node collection with node
    ObservableCollection<DiagramNode> NodeCollection = new ObservableCollection<DiagramNode>()
    {
        new DiagramNode()
        {
            //Position of the node
            OffsetX = 100,
            OffsetY = 100,
            //Size of the node
            Width = 100,
            Height = 100,
            //Unique Id of the node
            Id = "node1",
            //Sets type as Bpmn and shape as Activity
            Shape = new DiagramShape()
            {
                Type = Shapes.Bpmn,
                BpmnShape=BpmnShapes.Activity,
                //Sets activity as SubProcess
                Activity=new DiagramBpmnActivity()
                {
                    Activity=BpmnActivities.SubProcess,
                    //Sets collapsed as true and boundary as Call
                    SubProcess=new DiagramBpmnSubProcess()
                    {
                        Collapsed=true,
                        Boundary=BpmnBoundary.Call
                    },
                }
            }
        },
    };
}
```

The following table contains various types of BPMN boundaries.

| Boundary | Image |
| -------- | -------- |
| Call | ![Call Boundary BPMN Shape](images/Call.png) |
| Event | ![Event Boundary BPMN Shape](images/Eventtask.png) |
| Default | ![Default Boundary BPMN Shape](images/DefaultBoundary.png) |

## Data

A data object represents information flowing through the process, such as data placed into the process, data resulting from the process, data that needs to be collected, or data that must be stored. To define a [`DataObject`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.Diagrams.DiagramShape.html#Syncfusion_Blazor_Diagrams_DiagramShape_DataObject), set the shape as **DataObject** and the type property defines whether data is an input or an output. You can create multiple instances of data object with the collection property of data.

```csharp
@using Syncfusion.Blazor.Diagrams
@using System.Collections.ObjectModel

@* Initialize Diagram *@
<SfDiagram Width="500px" Height="@Height" Nodes="@NodeCollection">
</SfDiagram>

@code{
    public string Height { get; set; } = "500px";
    //Initialize node collection with node
    ObservableCollection<DiagramNode> NodeCollection = new ObservableCollection<DiagramNode>()
    {
        new DiagramNode()
        {
            //Position of the node
            OffsetX = 100,
            OffsetY = 100,
            //Size of the node
            Width = 100,
            Height = 100,
            //Unique Id of the node
            Id = "node1",
            //Sets type as Bpmn and shape as DataObject
            Shape = new DiagramShape()
            {
                Type = Shapes.Bpmn,
                BpmnShape=BpmnShapes.DataObject,
                //Sets collection as true when Dataobject is not a Single instance
                DataObject=new DiagramBpmnDataObject()
                {
                    Collection=true,
                    Type=BpmnDataObjects.Input
                }
            }
        },
    };
}
```

The following table contains various representation of BPMN data object.

| Boundary | Image |
| -------- | -------- |
| Collection Data Object | ![Collection Data BPMN Shape](images/Dataobject.png) |
| Data Input | ![Data Input BPMN Shape](images/DataInput.png) |
| Data Output | ![Data Output BPMN Shape](images/DataOutput.png) |

## Datasource

Datasource is used to store or access data associated with a business process. To create a datasource, set the shape as **DataSource**. The following code example illustrates how to create a datasource.

```csharp
@using Syncfusion.Blazor.Diagrams
@using System.Collections.ObjectModel

@* Initialize Diagram *@
<SfDiagram Width="500px" Height="@Height" Nodes="@NodeCollection">
</SfDiagram>

@code{
    public string Height { get; set; } = "500px";
    //Initialize node collection with node
    ObservableCollection<DiagramNode> NodeCollection = new ObservableCollection<DiagramNode>()
    {
        new DiagramNode()
        {
            //Position of the node
            OffsetX = 100,
            OffsetY = 100,
            //Size of the node
            Width = 100,
            Height = 100,
            //Unique Id of the node
            Id = "node1",
             //Sets type as Bpmn and shape as DataSource
            Shape = new DiagramShape()
            {
                Type = Shapes.Bpmn,
                BpmnShape=BpmnShapes.DataSource,
            }
        },
    };
}
```

## Artifact

Artifact is used to show additional information about a process in order to make it easier to understand. There are two types of artifacts in BPMN.

* Text annotation
* Group

## Text annotation

* A BPMN object can be associated with a text annotation which does not affect the flow but gives details about objects within a flow. The annotation property of the node is used to connect an annotation element to the BPMN node.

* The annotation element can be switched from a BPMN node to another BPMN node simply by dragging the source end of the annotation connector into the other BPMN node.

* The annotation angle property is used to set the angle between the BPMN shape and the annotation.

* The annotation direction property is used to set the direction of the text annotation.

* To set the size for text annotation, use width and height properties.

* The annotation length property is used to set the distance between the BPMN shape and the annotation.

* The annotation text property defines the additional information about the flow object in a BPMN process.

```csharp
@using Syncfusion.Blazor.Diagrams
@using System.Collections.ObjectModel

@* Initialize Diagram *@
<SfDiagram Width="500px" Height="@Height" Nodes="@NodeCollection">
</SfDiagram>

@code{
    public string Height { get; set; } = "500px";
    //Initialize node collection with node
    ObservableCollection<DiagramNode> NodeCollection = new ObservableCollection<DiagramNode>()
    {
        new DiagramNode()
        {
            //Position of the node
            OffsetX = 100,
            OffsetY = 100,
            //Size of the node
            Width = 100,
            Height = 100,
            //Unique Id of the node
            Id = "node1",
            //Sets type as Bpmn and shape as DataObject
            Shape = new DiagramShape()
            {
                Type = Shapes.Bpmn,
                BpmnShape=BpmnShapes.DataObject,
                //Sets collection as true when Dataobject is not a Single instance
                DataObject=new DiagramBpmnDataObject()
                {
                    Collection=true,
                    Type=BpmnDataObjects.Input
                }
            },
            //Sets the id, angle and text for the annotation
            Annotations=new ObservableCollection<DiagramNodeAnnotation>()
            {
                new DiagramNodeAnnotation()
                {
                    Id="Left",
                    RotateAngle=45,
                    Content="Left"
                }
            }
        },
    };
}
```

## Group

A group is used to frame a part of the diagram, shows that elements included in it are logically belong together and does not have any other semantics other than organizing elements. To create a group, the shape property of the node should be set as **group**. The following code example illustrates how to create a BPMN group.

```csharp
@using Syncfusion.Blazor.Diagrams
@using System.Collections.ObjectModel

@* Initialize Diagram *@
<SfDiagram Width="500px" Height="@Height" Nodes="@NodeCollection">
</SfDiagram>

@code{
    public string Height { get; set; } = "500px";
    //Initialize node collection with node
    ObservableCollection<DiagramNode> NodeCollection = new ObservableCollection<DiagramNode>()
    {
        new DiagramNode()
        {
            //Position of the node
            OffsetX = 100,
            OffsetY = 100,
            //Size of the node
            Width = 100,
            Height = 100,
            //Unique Id of the node
            Id = "node1",
            //Sets type as Bpmn and shape as Group
            Shape = new DiagramShape()
            {
                Type = Shapes.Bpmn,
                BpmnShape=BpmnShapes.Group,
            }
        }
    };
}
```

## BPMN flows

`BPMN Flows` are lines that connects BPMN flow objects.

## Association

[`BPMN Association`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.Diagrams.BpmnAssociationFlows.html) flow is used to link flow objects with its corresponding text or artifact. An association is represented as a dotted graphical line with opened arrow. The types of association are as follows:

* Directional
* BiDirectional
* Default

The association property allows you to define the type of association. The following code example illustrates how to create an association.

```csharp
@using Syncfusion.Blazor.Diagrams
@using System.Collections.ObjectModel

@* Initialize Diagram *@
<SfDiagram Width="500px" Height="@Height" Connectors="@ConnectorCollection">
</SfDiagram>

@code{
    public string Height { get; set; } = "500px";
    //Create connector and stored it to the connector collection
    ObservableCollection<DiagramConnector> ConnectorCollection = new ObservableCollection<DiagramConnector>()
    {
        new DiagramConnector()
        {
            //Unique Id of the connector
            Id="connector1",
            // Start and end point of the connector
            SourcePoint=new ConnectorSourcePoint(){X=100,Y=200},
            TargetPoint=new ConnectorTargetPoint(){X=300,Y=200},
            //Sets the type as Bpmn,flow as Association and association as bidirectional
            Shape=new DiagramConnectorShape()
            {
                Type=ConnectionShapes.Bpmn,
                BpmnFlow=BpmnFlows.Association,
                Association=BpmnAssociationFlows.BiDirectional
            }
        }
    };
}
```

The following table demonstrates the visual representation of association flows.

| Association | Image |
| -------- | -------- |
| Default | ![Default BPMN FlowShapes](images/Default1.png) |
| Directional | ![Directional BPMN FlowShapes](images/Directional1.png) |
| BiDirectional | ![BiDirectional BPMN FlowShapes](images/BiDirectional.png) |

>Note : The default value for the property `Association` is **Default**.

## Sequence

A [`Sequence`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.Diagrams.BpmnSequenceFlows.html) flow shows the order in which the activities are performed in a BPMN process and is represented by a solid graphical line. The types of sequence are as follows:

* Normal
* Conditional
* Default

The sequence property allows you to define the type of sequence. The following code example illustrates how to create a sequence flow.

```csharp
@using Syncfusion.Blazor.Diagrams
@using System.Collections.ObjectModel

@* Initialize Diagram *@
<SfDiagram Width="500px" Height="@Height" Connectors="@ConnectorCollection">
</SfDiagram>

@code{
    public string Height { get; set; } = "500px";
    //Create connector and stored it to the connector collection
    ObservableCollection<DiagramConnector> ConnectorCollection = new ObservableCollection<DiagramConnector>()
    {
        new DiagramConnector()
        {
            //Unique Id of the connector
            Id="connector1",
            // Start and end point of the connector
            SourcePoint=new ConnectorSourcePoint(){X=100,Y=200},
            TargetPoint=new ConnectorTargetPoint(){X=300,Y=200},
            //Sets type as Bpmn, flow as Sequence, and sequence as Conditional
            Shape=new DiagramConnectorShape()
            {
                Type=ConnectionShapes.Bpmn,
                BpmnFlow=BpmnFlows.Sequence,
                Sequence=BpmnSequenceFlows.Conditional
            }
        }
    };
}
```

The following table contains various representation of sequence flows.

| Sequence | Image |
| -------- | -------- |
| Default | ![Default Sequence BPMN Shpae](images/Default2.png) |
| Conditional | ![Conditional Sequence BPMN Shpae](images/Conditional.png) |
| Normal | ![Normal Sequence BPMN Shpae](images/Normal.png) |

> Note: The default value for the property `Sequence` is **Normal**.

## Message

A [`Message`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.Diagrams.BpmnMessageFlows.html) flow shows the flow of messages between two participants and is represented by dashed line. The types of message are as follows:

* InitiatingMessage
* NonInitiatingMessage
* Default

The message property allows you to define the type of message. The following code example illustrates how to define a message flow.

```csharp
@using Syncfusion.Blazor.Diagrams
@using System.Collections.ObjectModel

@* Initialize Diagram *@
<SfDiagram Width="500px" Height="@Height" Connectors="@ConnectorCollection">
</SfDiagram>

@code{
    public string Height { get; set; } = "500px";
    //Create connector and stored it to the connector collection
    ObservableCollection<DiagramConnector> ConnectorCollection = new ObservableCollection<DiagramConnector>()
    {
        new DiagramConnector()
        {
            //Unique Id of the connector
            Id="connector1",
            // Start and end point of the connector
            SourcePoint=new ConnectorSourcePoint(){X=100,Y=200},
            TargetPoint=new ConnectorTargetPoint(){X=300,Y=200},
            //Sets type as Bpmn, flow as Message, and message as InitiatingMessage
            Shape=new DiagramConnectorShape()
            {
                Type=ConnectionShapes.Bpmn,
                BpmnFlow=BpmnFlows.Message,
                Message=BpmnMessageFlows.InitiatingMessage
            }
        }
    };
}
```

The following table contains various representation of message flows.

| Message | Image |
| -------- | -------- |
| Default | ![Default Message BPMN Shape](images/Default1.png) |
| InitiatingMessage | ![InitiatingMessage Message BPMN Shape](images/IMessage.png) |
| NonInitiatingMessage | ![NonInitiatingMessage Message BPMN Shape](images/NIMessage.png) |

>Note: The default value for the property `Message` is **Default**.
