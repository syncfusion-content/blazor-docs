# Bezier segments interaction in Blazor Diagram Component

## How to interact with the bezier segments efficiently

While interacting with multiple bezier segments, maintain their control points at the same distance and angle by using the [BezierConnectorSettings.Smoothness](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.Diagram.BezierConnectorSettings.html#Syncfusion_Blazor_Diagram_BezierConnectorSettings_Smoothness) property of the Connector class.

| BezierSmoothness value | Description | Output |
|-------- | -------- | -------- |
| SymmetricDistance| Both control points of adjacent segments will be at the same distance when one of them is editing. | ![SymmetricDistance](../../../../images/SymmetricDistance.gif) |
| SymmetricAngle | Both control points of adjacent segments will be at the same angle when one of them is editing. | ![SymmetricAngle](../../../../images/SymmetricAngle.gif) |
| Both | Both control points of adjacent segments will be at the same angle and same distance when one of them is editing. | ![Symmetric](../../../../images/SmoothnessBoth.png) |
| None | Segmentâ€™s control points interact independently from each other. | ![SymmetricNone](../../../../images/SymmetricNone.gif)


## How to show or hide the bezier segment's control points

By using the [BezierConnectorSettings.ControlPointsVisibility](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.Diagram.BezierConnectorSettings.html#Syncfusion_Blazor_Diagram_BezierConnectorSettings_ControlPointsVisibility) property of the Connector class, you can enable or disable the visibility of the bezier segment's control points.

| ControlPointsVisibility value | Description | Output |
|-------- | -------- | -------- |
| None | It allows you to hide all control points of the bezier connector. | ![None](../../../../images/ControlpointsvisibilityNone.png) |
| Source | It allows you to show control points of the source segment and hides all other control points in a bezier connector. | ![Source](../../../../images/ControlpointsvisibilitySource.png) |
| Target | It allows you to show control points of the target segment and hides all other control points in a bezier connector. | ![Target](../../../../images/ControlpointsvisibilityTarget.png) |
| Intermediate | It allows you to show control points of the intermediate segments and hides all other control points in a bezier connector. | ![Intermediate](../../../../images/ControlpointsvisibilityIntermediate.png) |
| All | It allows you to show all the control points of the bezier connector, including the source, target, and intermediate segments' control points.| ![All](../../../../images/ControlpointsvisibilityAll.png) |

                new BezierSegment(){Type = ConnectorSegmentType.Bezier, Point = new DiagramPoint(){X = 900, Y = 350}}
            },

                //Define the visibility of the control points. 
                ControlPointsVisibility = ControlPointsVisibility.Intermediate 
            },
        };
        connectors.Add(connector1);
    }
