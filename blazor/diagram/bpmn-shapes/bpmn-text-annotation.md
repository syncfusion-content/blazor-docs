# BPMN Text Annotation in Blazor Diagram Component

* A BPMN object can be associated with a text annotation that does not affect the flow but gives details about objects within a flow. The annotation property of the node is used to connect an annotation element to the BPMN node.

* The annotation element can be switched from a BPMN node to another BPMN node simply by dragging the source end of the annotation connector into the other BPMN node.

* The annotation angle property is used to set the angle between the BPMN shape and the annotation.

* The annotation direction property is used to set the direction of the text annotation.

* To set the size for text annotation, use width and height properties.

* The annotation length property is used to set the distance between the BPMN shape and the annotation.

* The annotation text property defines the additional information about the flow object in a BPMN process.
