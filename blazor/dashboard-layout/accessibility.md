# Accessibility in Blazor Dashboard Layout Component

The [Blazor Dashboard Layout](https://www.syncfusion.com/blazor-components/blazor-dashboard) component has been designed keeping in mind the [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/) specifications, by applying the prompt `WAI-ARIA` roles, states, and properties. This component is characterized by ARIA accessibility support, which makes navigation easy for people who use assistive technologies (AT).

The Blazor Dashboard Layout component followed the accessibility guidelines and standards, including [ADA](https://www.ada.gov/), [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/), [WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) standards, and [WCAG roles](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#roles) that are commonly used to evaluate accessibility.

The accessibility compliance for the Blazor Dashboard Layout component is outlined below.

## WAI-ARIA attributes

The Blazor Dashboard Layout component followed the [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/) patterns to meet the accessibility. The following ARIA attributes are used in the Dashboard Layout component:
