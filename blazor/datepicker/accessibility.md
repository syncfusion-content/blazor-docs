# Accessibility in Blazor DatePicker Component

The web accessibility defines a way to make web content and web applications more accessible to disabled people. It especially helps the dynamic content change and advanced user interface components developed with Ajax, HTML, JavaScript, and related technologies.

The DatePicker provides built-in compliance with the [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/) specifications. WAI-ARIA supports can be achieved through the attributes like `aria-expanded`, `aria-disabled`, and `aria-activedescendant` applied to the input element.

To learn more about the accessibility of Calendar, refer to the Calendar's [Accessibility](../calendar/accessibility/) section.

It provides information about the widget for assistive technology to the disabled person in screen reader.

* **aria-expanded**: Attribute indicates the state of a collapsible element.
