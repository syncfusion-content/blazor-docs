#  Date Format in Blazor DatePicker Component

The date format can be used to specify how the date value is displayed or entered in a `DatePicker` control

The string format of the date value specifies how the date value should be represented as a string. Different countries and regions have different conventions for representing the date value in a string format. In addition to representing the date value in different string formats, it is also possible to specify the order in which the day, month, and year values appear in the string. For example, the day/month/year format could be written as `28-12-2022` or `28.12.2022`

By default, the DatePicker's format is based on the culture. You can also set the own [Custom Format](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/custom-date-and-time-format-strings) or [Standard Format](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/standard-date-and-time-format-strings) by using the [Format](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.Calendars.SfDatePicker-1.html#Syncfusion_Blazor_Calendars_SfDatePicker_1_Format) property.

> Once the date format property has been defined, it will be applied consistently to all cultures, regardless of their conventions for representing the date value. In other words, the date format property serves as a standardized way of representing the date value, ensuring that it is displayed and entered consistently regardless of the culture or region in which the application is used.
