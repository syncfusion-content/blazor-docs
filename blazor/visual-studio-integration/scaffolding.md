# Syncfusion Blazor Scaffolding

Syncfusion provides **Visual Studio Scaffolding** for the Syncfusion Blazor platform, that allowing you to quickly add code that interacts with data models and reduce the time it takes to develop with data operations in your application. Scaffolding simplifies the creation of Razor and Controller action methods for Syncfusion Blazor DataGrid, Charts, Scheduler, Diagram, Tree Grid, Rich Text Editor, and Document Editor, and PDF Viewer controls.

> Check that at least one Entity Framework model exists, and the application has been compiled once. If no Entity Framework model exists in your application, refer to this [documentation](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-create-an-application-using-blazor-and-entity-framework-core-1c1679d87c7e/) to generate the Entity Framework model. After the model file has been added, check that the required DBContext and properties are added. Now, build the application, and try scaffolding. If any changes made in the model properties, rebuild the application once before perform scaffolding.

> The Syncfusion Blazor Scaffolder is available from `v17.4.0.39` for Blazor server-side application and provided the Scaffolding support to Blazor client-side application from `v18.4.0.39`.

## Add a scaffolded item

The steps below assist you to how to add a scaffolded item to your Blazor application.

> Before use the Syncfusion Blazor Scaffolding, check whether the Syncfusion Blazor Template Studio Extension installed or not in Visual Studio Extension Manager by clicking on the Extensions -> Manage Extensions -> Installed. If this extension not installed, please install the extension by follow the steps from the [download and installation](download-and-installation) help topic.

1. If the application type is **Blazor ServerSide**, right-click the **Pages** folder in the Solution Explorer, click **Add**, and then select **New Scaffolded Item..**

    ![Scaffolded add-in from server project](images/Add_scaffold_Serverside.png)

    If the application type is **Blazor Hosted**, right-click the **Controllers** folder from **{Project Name}.Server** application in the Solution Explorer, click **Add**, and then select **New Scaffolded Item**.

    ![Scaffolded add-in from the hosted project](images/Add_scaffold_hosted.png)

    > Scheduler control is not applicable for Blazor Hosted application.

2. In the **Add New Scaffolded item** dialog, select **Syncfusion Blazor Scaffolder** and then click **‘Add’**.

    ![Choose Syncfusion Scaffolding from Visual Studio Add scaffold dialog](images/Syncfusion_scaffolder.png)

3. In the Syncfusion UI Scaffolder dialog, select the desired control to perform scaffolding, and then click **Next**.

    ![Choose required control](images/Control_Window.png)

4. The Syncfusion UI Scaffolder dialog for the selected control will be displayed. As application requirements, enter the **Controller/Service Name** and **Razor Name**, then select the active application's required **Model Class** and its relevant **Data Context Class**, and then click **Next**.

    ![Choose required Model](images/Model_Window.png)

5. The dialog for the selected control feature will be opened in the Syncfusion UI Scaffolder. Select the required features, update the necessary data fields, and then click **Add**.

    For **ServerSide Application**, both Local data and Remote data types will be available.

    ![Choose required selected control features for the serverside project](images/Feature_Window_serverside.png)

    For **Hosted Application**, Remote data type only available.

    ![Choose required selected control features for the hosted project](images/Fetaure_window_hosted.png)

6. With the selected features of the Syncfusion control code snippet, the **Controller/Service** file and the corresponding **Razor** files are generated.

    If you select **Local Data**, the service file and razor file will be added to the application.

    ![Required Controller and Razor files added in the project for the selected control](images/Files_for_local_data.png)

    If you select **Remote Data**, the controller file and razor file will be added to the application.

    ![Required Controller and Razor files added in the project for the selected control](images/Files_for_remote_data.png)

7. Then, add navigation to the created razor file based on your requirement to open on the webpage.

8. If you installed the trial setup or NuGet packages from nuget.org you must register the Syncfusion license key to your application since Syncfusion introduced the licensing system from 2018 Volume 2 (v16.2.0.41) Essential Studio release. Navigate to the [help topic](https://help.syncfusion.com/common/essential-studio/licensing/license-key#how-to-generate-syncfusion-license-key) to generate and register the Syncfusion license key to your application. Refer to this [blog](https://blog.syncfusion.com/post/Whats-New-in-2018-Volume-2-Licensing-Changes-in-the-1620x-Version-of-Essential-Studio.aspx?_ga=2.11237684.1233358434.1587355730-230058891.1567654773) post for understanding the licensing changes introduced in Essential Studio.

## Syncfusion Blazor Command-line Scaffolding

**Scaffolding command-line** for Syncfusion Blazor allows you to quickly add code that interacts with data models and reduce the amount of time it takes to develop with data operations in your application. Scaffolding simplifies the creation of view file and Controller action methods for Syncfusion Blazor DataGrid, Charts, Scheduler, Diagram, Tree Grid, Rich Text Editor, Document Editor, and PDF Viewer controls.

> Verify that at least one Entity Framework model exists. If your application lacks an Entity Framework model, use this [documentation](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-create-an-application-using-blazor-and-entity-framework-core-1c1679d87c7e/) to create one. After you've added the model file, double-check that the necessary DBContext and properties have been added. Now, build the application and experiment with scaffolding. If any changes made in the model properties, rebuild the application once before perform scaffolding.

## Install Command-line Scaffolding

Install **syncfusion.scaffolding** tool globally by using below command.

   ```dotnet tool install -g syncfusion.scaffolding```

## Update Command-line scaffolding

Update **syncfusion.scaffolding** tool globally by using below command.

   ```dotnet tool update -g syncfusion.scaffolding```

## Add a scaffolded item from command-line

The steps below will assist you to how to add a scaffolded item from command-line to your Blazor application.

> Before adding the scaffolded item from command-line, check whether the **dotnet-aspnet-codegenerator** tool is installed or not by **dotnet tool list -g** command in command prompt. if it is not installed, then install **dotnet-aspnet-codegenerator** tool globally by using this command **dotnet tool install -g dotnet-aspnet-codegenerator**.

1. After installed syncfusion.scaffolding tool, we can invoke syncfusion_scaffold command and it shows the available controls

    **syncfusion_scaffold**

    ![CommandLine Scaffold Available Controls](images/AvailableControl.png)

2. To add a scaffolded item from command-line you must invoke syncfusion_scaffold application like below syntax

    **syncfusion_scaffold [control][arguments]**

3. If you run the syncfusion_scaffold [control] command, the parameters of control shown like below image.

    ![control parameter details](images/controlparameter.png)

4. Run the following command to generate controller and view files through command-line by passing required arguments of the given control.

    ```syncfusion_scaffold {controlName} --project "{projectFileNamewithPath}" --model {model} -dc {dbContext} -cname {controllerName} -vname {viewName} [controlMantoryParameter] [controlMantatoryParameterValue]```

    ![CommandLine Scaffold](images/commandline.png)

5. As we can see controller and view files generated successfully and also added the Syncfusion NuGet packages and styles which is required to render Syncfusion control.
