The following steps will help you **upgrade the Syncfusion version** to the Syncfusion Blazor application via **Visual Studio 2019**:

> Before use the Syncfusion Blazor Project Migration, check whether the Syncfusion Blazor Template Studio Extension installed or not in Visual Studio Extension Manager by clicking on the Extensions -> Manage Extensions -> Installed.
