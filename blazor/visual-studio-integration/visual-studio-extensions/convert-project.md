# Converting Blazor application to Syncfusion Blazor application

Syncfusion Blazor conversion is a Visual Studio add-in that converts an existing Blazor application to the Syncfusion Blazor application by adding the required assemblies and theme files.

The steps below help you to convert the **Blazor application** to the **Syncfusion Blazor application** via the **Visual Studio 2019**:

> Before using the Syncfusion Blazor Project Conversion, check whether the Syncfusion Blazor Template Studio Extension installed or not in Visual Studio Extension Manager by clicking on the Extensions -> Manage Extensions -> Installed.

1. Open your existing Blazor application or create a new Blazor application.

2. To open the Syncfusion Project Conversion Wizard, follow either one of the options below:

    **Option 1:**

    Choose **Extensions -> Syncfusion -> Essential Studio for Blazor -> Convert Project...** in the Visual Studio 2019 menu.

    > The versions are loaded from the Syncfusion Blazor NuGet packages published in [NuGet.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=Tags%3A%22blazor%22syncfusion) and it requires internet connectivity.

4. Check the **“Enable a backup before converting”** checkbox if you want to take the project backup and choose the location.
