# Add Syncfusion Blazor component code

Syncfusion provides the Code Generator for the Blazor platform to add a code in the application quickly at the required place in the razor file. The Syncfusion extension adds the required Syncfusion component to render the code with namespaces, styles, and NuGet references. The Code Generator provides an easy-to-use wizard that interacts with data models and adds Syncfusion components with the required features to your application.

The following steps will help you to add the Syncfusion components code in your Blazor application through **Visual Studio 2019**:

> Before using the Syncfusion Blazor Code Generator, check whether the Syncfusion Blazor Extension is installed or not in Visual Studio Extension Manager by clicking on the Extensions -> Manage Extensions -> Installed. If it is not installed, please install the [Syncfusion Blazor Extension](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/visual-studio-integration/visual-studio-extensions/download-and-installation/).

1. Open your existing Blazor application.

2. To open the Syncfusion Blazor Code Generator Wizard, select one of the following options in the Razor file, and add Syncfusion components:

### NuGet Packages

The corresponding component NuGet packages will be added as NuGet references.
