# Styles and Appearances in Blazor ButtonGroup Component

To modify the ButtonGroup appearance, override the default CSS of the ButtonGroup component. The following table lists common CSS classes and their purposes. To scope changes to a specific instance, add a custom class via the componentâ€™s CssClass property and target that class in your styles. A custom theme can also be created using the Syncfusion Theme Studio.

|CSS Class | Purpose of Class |

| .e-btn:hover | Customizes buttons on hover. |
| .e-btn:focus | Customizes buttons when focused. |
