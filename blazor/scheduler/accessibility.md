# Accessibility in Blazor Scheduler Component

Accessibility is achieved in the Scheduler component through WAI-ARIA standard and keyboard navigation. The Scheduler features can be effectively accessed through assistive technologies such as screen readers.

## WAI-ARIA

WAI-ARIA (Accessibility Initiative – Accessible Rich Internet Applications) defines a way to increase the accessibility of web pages, dynamic content, and user interface components developed with Ajax, HTML, JavaScript, and related technologies. ARIA provides additional semantics to describe the role, state, and functionality of web components.

The following ARIA attributes are used in the Scheduler:

| Property | Functionalities |
|-------|---------|
| role | It  gives assistive technologies about how to handle each element in a widget. |
| aria-disabled | It indicates the disabled state of the Scheduler. |
| aria-selected | It indicates the currently selected cell of the Scheduler. |
| aria-live | It indicates a string value that labels the Scheduler element. |
| aria-label | It indicates the disabled state of the Scheduler and its items. |
| aria-labelledby | It indicates editor dialog title to the user through assistive technologies. |
| aria-describedby | It indicates editor dialog content description to the user through assistive technologies. |

## Keyboard navigation

All the Scheduler actions can be controlled via keyboard keys and is availed by using `AllowKeyboardInteraction` property which is set to true by default. The applicable key combinations and its relative functionalities are listed below.
