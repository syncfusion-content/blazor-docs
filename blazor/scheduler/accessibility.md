# Accessibility in Blazor Scheduler Component

The [Blazor Scheduler](https://www.syncfusion.com/blazor-components/blazor-scheduler) component followed the accessibility guidelines and standards, including [ADA](https://www.ada.gov/), [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/), [WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) standards, and [WCAG roles](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#roles) that are commonly used to evaluate accessibility.

## WAI-ARIA attributes

[WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/) (Accessibility Initiative â€“ Accessible Rich Internet Applications) defines a way to increase the accessibility of web pages, dynamic content, and user interface components developed with Ajax, HTML, JavaScript, and related technologies. ARIA provides additional semantics to describe the role, state, and functionality of web components.

The following ARIA attributes are used in the Scheduler:

| Attributes | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| role="main" |  Attribute added to the Scheduler element describes the actual role of the element and denote it as a main and unique content. |
| role="button" | Attribute is assigned to the appointments of Scheduler, to denote it as a clickable element. |
| aria-label | Attribute is set to the Scheduler parent element and its default value is Scheduler's current date. On every time, the date is navigated, this attribute is updated with appropriate current date values. It is also assigned to other scheduler UI elements such as previous and next date navigation buttons depicting its purpose, div element displaying date range in the header bar and appointment elements. |
| aria-labelledby | It indicates editor dialog title to the user through assistive technologies. |
| aria-describedby | It indicates editor dialog content description to the user through assistive technologies. |
| aria-disabled | Attribute is set to the appointment element to indicates the disabled state of the Scheduler. |

## Ensuring accessibility

The Blazor Scheduler component's accessibility levels are ensured through an [axe-core](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Deque.AxeCore.Playwright) software tool during automated testing.

The accessibility compliance of the Scheduler component is shown in the following sample. Open the [sample](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/accessibility/schedule) in a new window to evaluate the accessibility of the Scheduler component with accessibility tools.
