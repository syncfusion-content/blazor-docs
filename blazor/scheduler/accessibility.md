# Accessibility in Blazor Scheduler Component

The [Blazor Scheduler](https://www.syncfusion.com/blazor-components/blazor-scheduler) component followed the accessibility guidelines and standards, including [ADA](https://www.ada.gov/), [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/), [WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) standards, and [WCAG roles](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#roles) that are commonly used to evaluate accessibility.

The accessibility compliance for the Blazor Scheduler component is detailed below.

## WAI-ARIA Attributes

[WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/) (Accessibility Initiative – Accessible Rich Internet Applications) defines a way to increase the accessibility of web pages, dynamic content, and user interface components developed with Ajax, HTML, JavaScript, and related technologies. ARIA provides additional semantics to describe the role, state, and functionality of web components.

The following ARIA attributes are used in the Scheduler:

| Attributes | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| role="main" |  Attribute added to the Scheduler element describes the actual role of the element and denote it as a main and unique content. |
| role="button" | Attribute is assigned to the appointments of Scheduler, to denote it as a clickable element. |
| aria-label | Attribute is set to the Scheduler parent element and its default value is Scheduler's current date. On every time, the date is navigated, this attribute is updated with appropriate current date values. It is also assigned to other scheduler UI elements such as previous and next date navigation buttons depicting its purpose, div element displaying date range in the header bar and appointment elements. |
| aria-labelledby | It indicates editor dialog title to the user through assistive technologies. |
| aria-describedby | It indicates editor dialog content description to the user through assistive technologies. |
| aria-disabled | Attribute is set to the appointment element to indicates the disabled state of the Scheduler. |

## Keyboard Interaction

All interactive actions within the Blazor Scheduler can be controlled via keyboard keys, supporting users who rely on assistive technologies or prefer keyboard-only navigation. This functionality is enabled by the `AllowKeyboardInteraction` property, which is set to `true` by default. The key combinations and their functionalities are outlined below.

| Windows | Mac | Actions |
| ----- | ----- | ---- |
| <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>J</kbd> | <kbd>⌥</kbd> + <kbd>J</kbd> | Focuses the Scheduler [Provided from application end]. |
| <kbd>Tab</kbd> | <kbd>Tab</kbd> | Focuses the first or active item on the scheduler header bar and then moves the focus to the next available event elements. If no events present, then focus moves out of the component. |
| <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd> | <kbd>⇧</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd> | Reverse focusing of the Tab functionality. Inverse focusing of event elements from the last one and then moves onto the first or active item on Scheduler header bar and then moves out of the component. |

| <kbd>Escape</kbd> | <kbd>Escape</kbd> | Closes any of the popup that are in open state. |
| <kbd>↑</kbd> , <kbd>→</kbd> , <kbd>↓</kbd> , <kbd>←</kbd> | <kbd>↑</kbd> , <kbd>→</kbd> , <kbd>↓</kbd> , <kbd>←</kbd> | To move onto the next available cells in either of the needed directions (left, right, top and right) |
| <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Arrow</kbd> | <kbd>⇧</kbd> + Arrows (<kbd>↑</kbd> , <kbd>→</kbd> , <kbd>↓</kbd> , <kbd>←</kbd>) | For multiple cell selection on either direction. |
| <kbd>Delete</kbd> | <kbd>Delete</kbd> | Deletes one or more selected events. |

## Ensuring Accessibility

The Blazor Scheduler component's adherence to accessibility standards is rigorously validated through automated testing using [axe-core](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Deque.AxeCore.Playwright).

The accessibility compliance of the Scheduler component can be evaluated by opening the [sample](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/accessibility/schedule) in a new window and using various accessibility testing tools.
