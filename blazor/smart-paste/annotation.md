# Annotaions in Blazor Smart Paste Button Component

## Annotating form fields

The `data-smartpaste-description` is a useful attribute that allows you to customize how data is pasted into form fields. By default, the Syncfusion Blazor `Smart Paste Button` analyzes form fields like `<input>`, `<select>`, and `<textarea>` elements, generating descriptions based on their associated `<label>`, `name` attribute, `id` attribute or nearby text content.

These descriptions are then sent to the backend AI model to assist in accurately pasting the relevant data. However, for more control, you can override the default behavior by specifying custom descriptions for specific input field using the `data-smartpaste-description` attribute.

### Example

```cshtml

```
