# Dimensions in Blazor Linear Gauge Component

## Size for Linear Gauge

The height and width of the Linear Gauge can be set using the [Width](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.LinearGauge.SfLinearGauge.html#Syncfusion_Blazor_LinearGauge_SfLinearGauge_Width) and [Height](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.LinearGauge.SfLinearGauge.html#Syncfusion_Blazor_LinearGauge_SfLinearGauge_Height) properties in [SfLinearGauge](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.LinearGauge.SfLinearGauge.html) class.

### In Pixel

The size of the Linear Gauge can be set in pixel.

```cshtml
@using Syncfusion.Blazor.LinearGauge

<SfLinearGauge Width="100px" Height="350px">
    <LinearGaugeAxes>
        <LinearGaugeAxis>
            <LinearGaugePointers>
                <LinearGaugePointer></LinearGaugePointer>
            </LinearGaugePointers>
        </LinearGaugeAxis>
    </LinearGaugeAxes>
</SfLinearGauge>
```

### In Percentage

By setting value in percentage, Linear Gauge receives its dimension matching to its parent. For example, when the height is set as **50%**, Linear Gauge renders to half of the parent height. The Linear Gauge will be responsive when the width is set as **100%**.

```cshtml
@using Syncfusion.Blazor.LinearGauge

<SfLinearGauge Width="100%" Height="50%">
    <LinearGaugeAxes>
        <LinearGaugeAxis>
            <LinearGaugePointers>
                <LinearGaugePointer></LinearGaugePointer>
            </LinearGaugePointers>
        </LinearGaugeAxis>
    </LinearGaugeAxes>
</SfLinearGauge>
```
