# Localization in Blazor File Upload Component

The Syncfusion Blazor File Upload component can be localized to display static text, such as button labels and tooltips, in different languages. This is achieved by adding a resource file (`.resx`) for each culture and referencing it in your application.

The following UI elements of the File Upload component can be localized:

*   **Browse button text:** The label for the file selection button.
*   **Drop area hint:** The "Or drop files here" message.
*   **File status messages:** Text indicating success, failure, or upload progress.
*   **Action button tooltips:** Tooltips for buttons like "Clear" and "Upload."

To learn more about localizing Syncfusion Blazor components, refer to the [Blazor Localization](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/common/localization) documentation topic.
