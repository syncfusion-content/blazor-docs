# Globalization in Blazor Chat UI Component

The Syncfusion Blazor Chat component supports globalization features like `Localization` and `Right-to-Left (RTL)` alignment, enabling it to be adapted for different cultures and languages.

## Localization

The `Localization` feature allows for the translation of static text elements within the Chat component to a specific language.
To localize the Chat UI component, refer to the guidance provided in the main [Blazor Localization](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/common/localization) topic to localize Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> Blazor components.

## Right-to-Left (RTL)

The Right-to-Left (RTL) feature reverses the component's layout and text direction to support languages that are read from right to left, such as Arabic or Hebrew. Refer to [Blazor RTL](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/common/right-to-left) topic to provide RTL support for the Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> Blazor components.
