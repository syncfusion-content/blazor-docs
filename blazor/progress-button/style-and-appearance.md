# Styles and Appearances in Blazor ProgressButton Component

Customize the appearance of the ProgressButton by overriding the built-in CSS selectors of the component. Use scoped styles (for example, by adding a custom class via the CssClass parameter) to limit changes to specific instances. To create a consistent look-and-feel across the application, consider using built-in themes or generating a custom theme with the [Theme Studio](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/themestudio/?theme=material).

| CSS Class | Purpose of Class |
| ----- | ----- |
| .e-progress-btn | Customize the ProgressButton root element. |
| .e-progress-btn:hover | Customize the ProgressButton on hover. |
| .e-progress-btn:focus | Customize the ProgressButton when focused (keyboard or programmatic focus). |
| .e-progress-btn .e-spinner-pane .e-spinner-inner svg .e-path-circle | Customize the spinner visuals within the ProgressButton. |
