# Syncfusion Blazor AI Coding Assistants Release Notes

This document provides information about the changes and new features included in each version of the Syncfusion Blazor AI Coding Assistants, including the [Syncfusion.Blazor.MCP](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Syncfusion.Blazor.MCP) MCP Server, Skills, Agentic UI Builder and so on.

## MCP Server

**(v1.0.0) - August 3, 2026**

**Breaking Changes**

- The [@syncfusion/blazor-assistant](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@syncfusion/blazor-assistant) npm package has been migrated to the [Syncfusion.Blazor.MCP](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Syncfusion.Blazor.MCP) .NET package. As part of this transition, [@syncfusion/blazor-assistant](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@syncfusion/blazor-assistant) package has been deprecated and will no longer receive updates.

- The coding assistant tool identifier has been changed from **`sf_blazor_assistant`** to **`search_docs`** for a better naming convention.

**(v3.0.0) - July 21, 2026**

**Breaking Changes**

- The **UI Builder** tool has been redefined as an agent-skill based experience and is no longer available within this server. For more information about the **Agentic UI Builder**, refer to this [link](https://www.syncfusion.com/explore/agentic-ui-builder).

**(v2.0.0) – February 23, 2026**

**Features**

- Introduced **Agentic UI Builder** — a composite MCP tool that analyzes your UI requirements and coordinates specialized tools (Layout, Component, and Styling) to generate complete Blazor applications using natural language prompts, significantly boosting your productivity and accelerating development workflow.
- Agentic UI Builder sub-tools:
  - **Layout Tool** (#sf_blazor_layout) — Generates responsive UI blocks, grids, dashboards, and pre-built patterns.
  - **Component Tool** (#sf_blazor_component) — Provides full metadata, APIs, props, events, and configuration for 145+ Blazor components.
  - **Styling Tool** (#sf_blazor_style) — Applies theme configurations (Tailwind3 CSS, Bootstrap 5.3, Material 3, Fluent 2), dark mode, color customization, and icon integration.
- Unlimited, unrestricted access with strict privacy (no project file access, no prompt storage or training).

**Breaking Changes**

- Renamed the coding assistant tool identifier from **`SyncfusionBlazorAssistant`** to **`sf_blazor_assistant`** for consistency, brevity, and improved user experience.

**(v1.0.1) – February 10, 2026**

**Features**

- Updated package dependencies to resolve security vulnerabilities and enhance stability.

**(v1.0.0) – December 16, 2025**

**Features**

- Added support for API key validation through file path reference.
- Updated package dependencies and security standards for improved reliability and safety.

**(v0.1.0) – October 10, 2025**

**Features**

- Initial release of AI Coding Assistant for Blazor components.
- Provides context-aware assistance for building Blazor applications with Blazor components.
- Includes support for component APIs, properties, and troubleshooting guidance.

## Skills

**Features**

- Introduced [Agent Skills](https://www.syncfusion.com/explore/agent-skills) — a set of lightweight, modular capabilities that extend the AI Coding Assistants with specialized knowledge, including pre-defined instructions, best practices, and curated code patterns for building Blazor applications with Syncfusion components.
- Each skill is defined in a simple, readable `SKILL.md` file that specifies the correct setup, required modules, current APIs and patterns, and what a valid implementation looks like for a given component.
- Works as a standard, lightweight approach supported by modern AI development tools: install skills, the tool detects them, and the relevant skill is automatically applied to the user's prompt.

## Agentic UI Builder

**(v1.0.0) - Jun 5, 2026**

**Features**

- Evolved the [Agentic UI Builder](https://www.syncfusion.com/explore/agentic-ui-builder) architecture with Agent Skills, bringing implementation guidance directly into the project environment for more project-aware, context-grounded UI generation.
- Made UI generation easier to customize and align with internal coding standards and conventions.
- Streamlined the local development experience while preserving the same AI-assisted UI generation workflow developers already rely on.
