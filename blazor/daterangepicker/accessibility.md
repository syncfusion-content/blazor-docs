## WAI-ARIA attributes

The web accessibility makes web content and web applications more accessible for people with disabilities. It especially helps in dynamic content change and development of advanced user interface controls with AJAX, HTML, JavaScript, and related technologies. DateRangePicker provides built-in compliance with [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/) specifications. WAI-ARIA
support is achieved through the attributes like `aria-expanded`, `aria-disabled`, and `aria-activedescendant` applied as an input element.

To learn about the accessibility of Calendar, refer to the Calendar's [Accessibility](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/calendar/accessibility) section.

It helps people with disabilities by providing information about the widget for assistive technology in the screen readers. DateRangePicker component contains grid role and grid cell for each day cell.

* **aria-expanded**: Indicates the currently selected date of the DateRangePicker component.

* **aria-disabled**: Indicates the disabled state of the DateRangePicker component.
