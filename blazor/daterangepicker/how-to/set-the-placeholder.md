# Set the Placeholder

The following code demonstrates how to set [Placeholder](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.Calendars.SfDateRangePicker.html#Syncfusion_Blazor_Calendars_SfDateRangePicker_Placeholder) in the DateRangePicker component.

Using `Placeholder`, you can display a short hint in the input element.

```cshtml
@using Syncfusion.Blazor.Calendars

<SfDateRangePicker TValue="DateTime?" Placeholder="Choose a date range"></SfDateRangePicker>
```

The output will be as follows.
