# Resizing in AutoComplete

You can dynamically adjust the size of the popup in the `Autocomplete` component by using the `AllowResize `property. When enabled, users can resize the popup, improving visibility and control, with the resized dimensions being retained across sessions for a consistent user experience.

{% highlight Razor %}

{% include_relative code-snippet/popup-setting/resize.razor %}

{% endhighlight %}
