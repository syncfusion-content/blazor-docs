# Custom value enable and disable

The AutoComplete allows the users to give input as custom value, which is not required to present in predefined set of values. By default, this support is enabled by the [AllowCustom](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.DropDowns.AutoCompleteModel.html#Syncfusion_Blazor_DropDowns_AutoCompleteModel_AllowCustom)Â property. The custom value will be sent to post back handler when a form is about to be submitted.
