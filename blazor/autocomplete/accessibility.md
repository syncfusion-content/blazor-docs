# Accessibility in Blazor AutoComplete Component

The [Blazor AutoComplete](https://www.syncfusion.com/blazor-components/blazor-autocomplete) component has been designed, keeping in mind the [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/) specifications, and applies the `WAI-ARIA` roles, states, and properties along with `keyboard support`. This component is characterized by complete keyboard interaction support and ARIA accessibility support that makes it easy for people who use assistive technologies (AT) or those who completely rely on keyboard navigation.

The Blazor AutoComplete component followed the accessibility guidelines and standards, including [ADA](https://www.ada.gov/), [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/), [WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) standards, and [WCAG roles](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#roles) that are commonly used to evaluate accessibility.

The accessibility compliance for the Blazor AutoComplete component is outlined below.

## WAI-ARIA attributes

The Blazor AutoComplete component uses the `combobox` role and each list item has an `option` role. The following `ARIA Attributes` denotes the AutoComplete state:

| **Property** | **Functionalities** |

| `aria-expanded` | Indicates whether the suggestion list has expanded or not. |
| `aria-selected` | Indicates the selected option from the list. |
| `aria-readonly` | Indicates the readonly state of the AutoComplete element. |
| `aria-disabled` | Indicates whether the AutoComplete component is in disabled state or not.|
| `aria-activedescendent` | This attribute holds the ID of the active list item to focus its descendant child element. |
| `aria-owns` | This attribute contains the ID of the suggestion list to indicate popup as a child element. |
| `aria-autocomplete` | This attribute contains the ‘both’ to a list of options shows and the currently selected suggestion also shows inline. |

## Ensuring accessibility

The Blazor AutoComplete component's accessibility levels are ensured through an [axe-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axe-core) software tool during automated testing.

The accessibility compliance of the AutoComplete component is shown in the following sample. Open the [sample](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/accessibility/autocomplete) in a new window to evaluate the accessibility of the AutoComplete component with accessibility tools.
