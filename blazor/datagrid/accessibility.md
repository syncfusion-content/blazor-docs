# Accessibility in Blazor Grid component

The Grid component followed the accessibility guidelines and standards, including [ADA](https://www.ada.gov/), [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/), [WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) standards, and [WCAG roles](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#roles) that are commonly used to evaluate accessibility.

## WAI-ARIA attributes

The Grid component followed the [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/grid/) patterns to meet the accessibility. The following ARIA attributes are used in the Grid component:

| Attributes | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `role=grid` | To represent the element containing the grid component. |
| `role=row` | To represent the element containing the cells of the row in the grid. |
| `role=rowgroup` | To represent the group of rows in the grid. |
| `role=columnheader` | To represent the cell in a row contains header information for a column in the grid. |
| `role=gridcell` | To represent a cell in the grid component. |
| `role=button` | To represent the element that acts as a button in the grid. |
| `role=search` | To represent the element that acts as a search region in the grid. |
| `role=presentation` | To represent the element to be not available for accessibility concerns. |
| `role=navigation` | To represent the element containing pager elements to navigate from one page to another. |
| `aria-colindex` | Defines the column index of the column with respect to the total number of columns within the grid. |
| `aria-rowindex` | Defines row index of the row with respect to the total number of rows within the grid.  |

| `aria-busy` | Indicates an element is being modified and that assistive technologies may want to wait until the changes are complete before informing the user about the update. |
| `aria-owns` | Identifies an element in order to define a visual, functional, or contextual relationship between a parent and its child elements. |
| `aria-hidden` | Hides the element from accessibility concerns. |
| `aria-labelledby` | Provides an accessible name for the checkbox labels in excel filter, checkbox filter and column chooser dialog.  |

## Ensuring accessibility

The Grid component's accessibility levels are ensured through an [accessibility-checker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/accessibility-checker) and [axe-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axe-core) software tools during automated testing.

The accessibility compliance of the Grid component is shown in the following sample. Open the [sample](https://blazorplayground.syncfusion.com/embed/VXrzZLMViScgbigc?appbar=false&editor=false&result=true&errorlist=false&theme=bootstrap5) in a new window to evaluate the accessibility of the Grid component with accessibility tools.
