# Persisting data in the server in Blazor DataGrid

The Syncfusion Blazor DataGrid enables you to persist data changes made in the Grid to a server or database using RESTful web services. All CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) operations performed in the Grid are managed by the [SfDataManager](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.Data.SfDataManager.html), which can bind to server-side data sources and synchronize updates with the backend. This ensures that any changes made in the UI are reliably saved to your data store.

> The [ODataAdaptor](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/data/adaptors#odata-adaptor) persists data in the server according to the **OData** protocol.

Syncfusion provides multiple adaptors to handle different server protocols and APIs, enabling smooth integration with RESTful services. Below are the various adaptors you can use to persist data in the Grid.

**Using UrlAdaptor**

The [UrlAdaptor](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/data/adaptors#url-adaptor) is the default adaptor for connecting the Syncfusion Blazor DataGrid to remote data services via URLs. It enables seamless data binding and interaction with custom APIs or any remote service that exposes endpoints for CRUD operations. Use the `UrlAdaptor` when your API has custom logic for handling data operations.

For more information, see the [UrlAdaptor documentation](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/datagrid/connecting-to-adaptors/url-adaptor).

**Using ODataV4Adaptor**

The [ODataV4Adaptor](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/data/adaptors#odatav4-adaptor) allows the Syncfusion Blazor DataGrid to integrate with OData V4 services, supporting efficient data querying and manipulation. You can perform CRUD operations using the `ODataV4Adaptor` to ensure compatibility with OData-compliant backend.

For more information, see the [ODataV4Adaptor documentation](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/datagrid/connecting-to-adaptors/odatav4-adaptor).

**Using WebApiAdaptor**

The [WebApiAdaptor](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/data/adaptors#web-api-adaptor) is designed for use with Web APIs that follow the **OData** protocol. It extends the capabilities of the `ODataAdaptor` and enables smooth communication between the Grid and OData-based Web APIs for data retrieval and updates.

For more information, see the [WebApiAdaptor documentation](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/datagrid/connecting-to-adaptors/web-api-adaptor).

**Using GraphQLAdaptor**

GraphQL is a powerful query language for APIs designed to provide a more efficient alternative to traditional REST APIs. It allows you to precisely fetch the data you need, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching of data. GraphQL offers a flexible and expressive syntax for querying, enabling clients to request only the specific data they require.

The [GraphQLAdaptor](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/data/adaptors#graphql-service-binding) simplifies the interaction between the Syncfusion Blazor DataGrid and GraphQL servers, allowing for efficient data retrieval with support for various operations such as CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete).

For more information, see the [GraphQLAdaptor documentation](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/datagrid/connecting-to-adaptors/graphql-adaptor).
