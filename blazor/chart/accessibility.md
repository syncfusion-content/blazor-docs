## WAI-ARIA attributes

WAI-ARIA(Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications) defines a way to increase the accessibility of web pages, dynamic content, and user interface components developed with AJAX, HTML, JavaScript, and related technologies. ARIA provides additional semantics to describe the role, state, and functionality of web components.

Element |Default description
-----|-----
Datalabel |Reads the Point y value.
Legend |Click to show or hide the series.
Axis Title |Reads the axis title.
Chart Title |Reads the chart title.
Series Points |Reads the Point x: Point y value.

The Blazor Chart component followed the [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/alert/) patterns to meet the accessibility. The following ARIA attributes are used in the Blazor Chart component:

* img (role)
* button (role)
* region (role)
* aria-label (attribute)
* aria-hidden (attribute)
* aria-pressed (attribute)

## Keyboard navigation

The Blazor Chart component followed the [keyboard interaction](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/alert/#keyboardinteraction) guideline, making it easy for people who use assistive technologies (AT) and those who completely rely on keyboard navigation. The following keyboard shortcuts are supported by the Blazor Chart component.
