# Accessibility in Blazor Chart Component

Accessibility is achieved in the Chart component through WAI-ARIA standard and keyboard navigation. The chart features can be effectively accessed through assistive technologies such as screen readers.

The Chart control followed the accessibility guidelines and standards, including [ADA](https://www.ada.gov/), [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/), [WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) standards, and [WCAG roles](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#roles) that are commonly used to evaluate accessibility.

The accessibility compliance for the Chart control is outlined below.

## WAI-ARIA

WAI-ARIA(Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications) defines a way to increase the accessibility of web pages, dynamic content, and user interface components developed with AJAX, HTML, Javascript, and related technologies. ARIA provides additional semantics to describe the role, state, and functionality of web components.

The following ARIA attributes are used in the chart:

Element |Default description
-----|-----
Datalabel |Reads the Point y value.
Legend |Click to show or hide the series.
Axis Title |Reads the axis title.
Chart Title |Reads the chart title.
Series Points |Reads the Point x: Point y value.
