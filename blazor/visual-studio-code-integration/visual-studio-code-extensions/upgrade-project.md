# Upgrade project

Syncfusion Project Migration is a Visual Studio Code add-in that allows you to migrate the existing Syncfusion Blazor Web Application from one Essential Studio version to another version.

   > The Syncfusion Blazor Web Application Project Migration utility is available from `v17.4.0.39`.

The following steps help you to migrate your existing Syncfusion Blazor Web Application.

1. Open an existing Syncfusion Blazor Web Application or create a new Syncfusion Blazor Web Application in Visual Studio Code.

2. Right-click the Project file from Explorer (Workspace), select the Migrate Syncfusion Blazor Application to another version… Refer to the following screenshot for more information.

5. If you installed the trial setup or NuGet packages from nuget.org you have to register the Syncfusion license key to your project since Syncfusion introduced the licensing system from 2018 Volume 2 (v16.2.0.41) Essential Studio release. Navigate to the [help topic](https://help.syncfusion.com/common/essential-studio/licensing/license-key#how-to-generate-syncfusion-license-key) to generate and register the Syncfusion license key to your project.
