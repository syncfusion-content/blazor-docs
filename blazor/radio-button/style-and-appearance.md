# Styles and Appearances in Blazor RadioButton Component

To modify the RadioButton appearance, override the componentâ€™s default CSS. The following table lists common CSS selectors and their purposes within the RadioButton. Ensure custom CSS is loaded after the Syncfusion theme so overrides take effect. A custom theme for all controls can also be created using the [Theme Studio](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/themestudio/?theme=material).

| CSS Class | Purpose of Class |
| ----- | ----- |
| .e-radio-wrapper | To customize the radio button wrapper. |
| .e-radio + label:hover::before | To customize the radiobutton on hover. |
| .e-radio:checked + label::after, e-radio:checked + label::before | To customize the checked radiobutton. |
| .e-radio:checked:focus + label::before, .e-radio:checked + label:hover::before | To customize the checked radiobutton on hover. |
