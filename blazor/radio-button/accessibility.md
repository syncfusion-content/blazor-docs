## WAI-ARIA attributes

The RadioButton component followed the [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/radio/) patterns to meet the accessibility. The following ARIA attributes are used in the RadioButton component:

| Attributes | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `aria-disabled` | Indicates that the element is perceivable but disabled, so it is not editable or otherwise operable. |

## Keyboard interaction

The following keyboard shortcuts are supported by the RadioButton component.
