# How to add Syncfusion Component to the toolbox in Blazor Application

This section guides you through adding Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> Blazor components to the Visual Studio Toolbox. By default, the Toolbox displays HTML elements and Bootstrap snippets. To customize it for Blazor development, open the Toolbox by pressing `Ctrl + Alt + X` or by navigating to **View â†’ Toolbox** from the top menu.

To include Syncfusion components for Blazor in the Toolbox, follow these steps:

1. Right-click anywhere within the Visual Studio Toolbox window, select **Add Tab** from the context menu, name the new tab (e.g., Syncfusion Blazor Components), and press Enter to create it.

2. In a code editor, create or paste a Blazor component code snippet, such as a Syncfusion Calendar, highlight it, and drag it into the newly created tab in the Visual Studio Toolbox.

3. The Visual Studio Toolbox will automatically generate a name for the item based on the code snippet; rename it to a more descriptive title, like **SfCalendar**, for improved clarity.
