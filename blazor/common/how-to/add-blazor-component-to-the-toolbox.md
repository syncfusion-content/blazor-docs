# How to add Syncfusion Component to the toolbox in Blazor Application

This section explains how to add Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> Blazor component to the toolbox. To customize the Visual Studio Toolbox for Blazor, which by default shows HTML components and Bootstrap snippets, you can open the Toolbox by pressing `Ctrl+Alt+X` or navigating to **View â†’ Toolbox** in the menu.

To include Syncfusion components for Blazor in the Toolbox, follow these steps:

1. Right-click anywhere in the Toolbox window and choose Add Tab from the context menu. Enter a name for the new tab, such as Syncfusion Blazor Components, and press Enter to create it.

2. In a code editor, write or paste a code snippet for a Blazor component, such as a Syncfusion Calendar. Highlight the code, then drag and drop it into the newly created tab in the Toolbox.

3. The Toolbox will automatically assign a name to the item based on the code snippet. You can rename it to something more descriptive, like **SfCalendar**, for better clarity.
