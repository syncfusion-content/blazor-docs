# How to add Syncfusion Component to the toolbox in Blazor Application

This section provides step-by-step guidance on how to add Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> Blazor components to the Visual Studio Toolbox. By default, the Toolbox displays HTML elements and Bootstrap snippets. To customize it for Blazor development, open the Toolbox by pressing `Ctrl + Alt + X` or by navigating to **View → Toolbox** from the top menu.

To include Syncfusion components for Blazor in the Toolbox, follow these steps:

1. Right-click anywhere within the Visual Studio Toolbox window, select **Add Tab** from the context menu. Enter a name for the new tab such as Syncfusion Blazor Components and press Enter to create it.

2. In the code editor, write or paste a Blazor component snippet, such as the Syncfusion SfCalendar. Once the code is in place, select the entire code snippet, then drag and drop it into the newly created tab in the Visual Studio Toolbox.

3. Once the code snippet is added, the Toolbox will automatically assign it a default name based on the snippet content.
To improve clarity, right-click the item, select **Rename**, and enter a more descriptive name—such as **SfCalendar**.
