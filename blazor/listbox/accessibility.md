## WAI-ARIA attributes

The Blazor ListBox component follows the [WAI-ARIA listbox pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/listbox/) to meet accessibility requirements. The following ARIA attributes are used in the Blazor ListBox component:

| Attributes | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `role` | Indicates the ListBox component wrapper element as `listbox`, the `ul` element as `presentation`, and each list item as `option`. |
| `aria-label` | Provides an accessible name for the ListBox component. |
| `aria-multiselectable` | Applied to the element with the `listbox` role to indicate that multiple selection is supported. This is applied when multiple selection is enabled (default behavior). |
| `aria-selected` | Applied to elements with the `option` role that are visually styled as selected to inform assistive technologies that the options are selected. |

## Keyboard interaction

The Blazor ListBox component follows the [keyboard interaction](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/listbox/#keyboardinteraction) guidelines, supporting users of assistive technologies and those who rely on keyboard navigation. The following keyboard shortcuts are supported by the Blazor ListBox component.
| Windows | Mac| Actions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| <kbd>↑</kbd> | <kbd>↑</kbd> | Moves focus to the previous option. |
| <kbd>↓</kbd> | <kbd>↓</kbd> | Moves focus to the next option. |
| <kbd>Home</kbd> | <kbd>Home</kbd> | Moves focus to the first option. |
| <kbd>End</kbd> | <kbd>End</kbd> | Moves focus to the last option. |
| <kbd>Space</kbd> | <kbd>Space</kbd> | Toggles the selection state of the focused option. |
| <kbd>Ctrl + A</kbd> | <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>A</kbd> | Selects all options in the list. |
| <kbd>Ctrl + Shift + Home</kbd> | <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>⇧</kbd> + <kbd>Home</kbd> | Selects the focused option and all options up to the first option. |
| <kbd>Ctrl + Shift + End</kbd> | <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>⇧</kbd> + <kbd>End</kbd> | Selects the focused option and all options down to the last option. |
| <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>↑</kbd> or <kbd>↓</kbd> | <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>↑</kbd> or <kbd>↓</kbd> | Moves focus without changing the current selection. Use Ctrl/Cmd with mouse click to toggle individual items. |
