# Text Wrapping Style in DocumentEditor

Text wrapping refers to how images and shapes are fit with surrounding text in a document. Currently, DocumentEditor has only preservation support for image and textbox shape with below wrapping styles.

## In-Line with Text

In this option, the image or shape is placed on the same line surrounding with text like any other word or letter. This image or shape will be automatically moved along with the text while editing, whereas the other options denote that the image or shape stays in a fixed position while the text shifts and wraps around it.
