# Working with Paragraph Formatting in Blazor DocumentEditor Component

[Blazor Document Editor](https://www.syncfusion.com/blazor-components/blazor-word-processor) supports various paragraph formatting options such as text alignment, indentation, paragraph spacing, and more.

## Indentation

You can modify the left or right indentation of selected paragraphs using the following sample code.

```csharp
await documentEditor.Selection.ParagraphFormat.SetLeftIndentAsync(24);
await documentEditor.Selection.ParagraphFormat.SetRightIndentAsync(24);
```

## Special indentation

You can define special indent for first line of the paragraph using the following sample code.

```csharp
await documentEditor.Selection.ParagraphFormat.SetFirstLineIndentAsync(24);
```

## Increase indent

You can increase the left indent of selected paragraphs by a factor of 36 points using the following sample code.

```csharp
await documentEditor.Editor.IncreaseIndentAsync();
```

## Decrease indent

You can decrease the left indent of selected paragraphs by a factor of 36 points using the following sample code.

```csharp
await documentEditor.Editor.DecreaseIndentAsync();
```

## Text alignment

You can get or set the text alignment of selected paragraphs using the following sample code.

```csharp
await documentEditor.Selection.ParagraphFormat.SetTextAlignmentAsync(TextAlignment.Center);
```

You can toggle the text alignment of selected paragraphs by specifying a value using the following sample code.

```csharp
await documentEditor.Editor.ToggleTextAlignmentAsync(TextAlignment.Center);
```

## Line spacing and its type

You can define the line spacing and its type for selected paragraphs using the following sample code.

```csharp
await documentEditor.Selection.ParagraphFormat.SetLineSpacingTypeAsync(LineSpacingType.AtLeast);
await documentEditor.Selection.ParagraphFormat.SetLineSpacingAsync(6);
```

## Paragraph spacing

You can define the spacing before or after the paragraph by using the following sample code.

```csharp
await documentEditor.Selection.ParagraphFormat.SetBeforeSpacingAsync(24);
await documentEditor.Selection.ParagraphFormat.SetAfterSpacingAsync(24);
```

## Show or Hide Paragraph marks

You can show or hide the hidden formatting symbols like spaces, tab, paragraph marks, and breaks in Document editor component. These marks help identify the start and end of a paragraph and all the hidden formatting symbols in a Word document.

The following example code illustrates how to show or hide paragraph marks.

```csharp
<SfDocumentEditorContainer @ref="container" Height="590px" DocumentEditorSettings="settings">
</SfDocumentEditorContainer>

@code {
    SfDocumentEditorContainer container;
    DocumentEditorSettingsModel settings = new DocumentEditorSettingsModel() { ShowHiddenMarks = true };
}
```
