# Why Do I Get the Unsupported Warning Message When Opening a Document?

If you receive an "The file format you have selected isn't supported. Please choose valid format." message when opening a document in the Document Editor, it typically indicates that the document format is not supported by the current version of the Document Editor. Here are some common reasons for this warning:
1.	Unsupported File Format: The document you are trying to open might be in a format that the Document Editor does not support. Ensure you are using a supported format, such as SFDT.
2.	Corrupted Document: The document file might be corrupted or improperly formatted. Try opening a different document to see if the issue persists.
To avoid this warning, always use the recommended document formats and features supported by the Document Editor. 

Document Editor supports the following file formats:
•	Word Document (*.docx)
•	Syncfusion Document Text (*.sfdt)
•	Plain Text (*.txt)
•	Word Template (*.dotx)
•	HyperText Markup Language (*.html)
•	Rich Text Format (*.rtf)
•	Word XML Document(*.xml)
•	Word 97-2003 Template (*.dot)
•	Word 97-2003 Document (*.doc)

By using these supported formats, you can ensure compatibility and avoid unsupported warning messages when opening documents in the Document Editor.
