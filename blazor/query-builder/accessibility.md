| Attributes | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `role` | Identifies the Query Builder region and roles on interactive controls to assist screen readers. |

## Keyboard interaction

| Windows | Mac | Actions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| <kbd>Tab</kbd> / <kbd>Shift + Tab</kbd> | <kbd>Tab</kbd> / <kbd>⇧</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd> | Move focus between fields, operators, values, and action buttons within a rule. |
