## WAI-ARIA attributes

WAI-ARIA (Accessibility Initiative – Accessible Rich Internet Applications) defines a way to increase the accessibility of web pages, dynamic content, and user interface components developed with Ajax, HTML, JavaScript, and related technologies. ARIA provides additional semantics to describe the role, state, and functionality of web components.

The following list of ARIA attributes is used in Blazor Query Builder.

| Attributes | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `role` | Indicates the query builder component. |

| <kbd>Tab</kbd> / <kbd>Shift + Tab</kbd> | <kbd>Tab</kbd> / <kbd>⇧</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd> | To focus the next item in the rule. |
