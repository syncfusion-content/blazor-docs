# Localization in Blazor QueryBuilder Component

[Blazor QueryBuilder](https://www.syncfusion.com/blazor-components/blazor-query-builder) supports localization for UI text (such as button labels, operator names, and messages) and honors the applicationâ€™s culture for date and number formatting. See the [Blazor Localization](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/common/localization) topic for end-to-end guidance on configuring languages, providing translations, and switching cultures in Blazor apps.

N> You can also explore our [Blazor Query Builder example](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/demos/query-builder/default-functionalities?theme=bootstrap5) to know how to render and configure the query builder.
