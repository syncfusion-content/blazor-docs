# Predefined code templates for blazor

Blazor Playground simplifies the process of incorporating UI components by offering a collection of pre-defined code templates for various components. These snippets are conveniently displayed in a popup, making it easy for users to browse and select their preferred Syncfusion components. 

By choosing a component and clicking the "add" button, Playground significantly reduces the time needed to render the component in your project.

## Accessing Code Snippets

Click the "snippet" button to open a popup containing a list of predefined code templates for various UI components.
