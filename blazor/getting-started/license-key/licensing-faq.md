# Syncfusion&reg; Licensing FAQ

## Is an internet connection required for Syncfusion&reg; Essential Studio&reg; license validation?

* Syncfusion&reg; license validation is done offline during application execution and does not require internet access. 

* Apps registered with a Syncfusion&reg; license key can be deployed on any system that does not have an internet connection.

## How to upgrade from trial version after purchasing a license

To upgrade from trial version, there are two possible solutions.

* Uninstall the trial version and install the fully licensed build from the [License & Downloads](https://www.syncfusion.com/account/downloads) section of our website.

* If you are using Syncfusion&reg; controls from [nuget.org](https:/www.nuget.org/packages?q=syncfusion), replace the currently used trial license key with a paid license key that can be generated from the [License & Downloads](https://www.syncfusion.com/account/downloads) section of our website. Refer to [this](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/getting-started/license-key/how-to-register-in-an-application) topic for more information regarding registering the license in the application.

N> License registration is not required if you reference Syncfusion&reg; assemblies from Licensed installer. These licensing changes applicable to all evaluators who refers the Syncfusion&reg; assemblies from evaluation installer and those who use Syncfusion&reg; NuGet packages from [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/).

## Where can I get a license key

License keys can be generated from the [License & Downloads](https://syncfusion.com/account/downloads) or [Trial & Downloads](https://www.syncfusion.com/account/manage-trials/downloads) section of the Syncfusion&reg; website.
