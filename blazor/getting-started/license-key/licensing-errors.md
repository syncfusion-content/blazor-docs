## Facing licensing error message even after registering proper license keys

1. Ensure that respective version [Syncfusion.Licensing](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Syncfusion.Licensing/) nuget package or assembly is referred properly in the application.

2. Ensure that all the Syncfusion assemblies referenced are of the same version and that the corresponding version and product's license key is registered in the application.

3. The license key should be registered before initializing any Syncfusion controls in the application. Refer this page for more information on registering license keys.

4. Same version Syncfusion assemblies should be present in the application output folders or published folders.

5. If you've upgraded the Syncfusion version and license keys in the application, try cleaning and rebuilding the application to see if that resolves the license error message.
