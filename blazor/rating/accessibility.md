## WAI-ARIA attributes

The Blazor Rating component followed the [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/slider/) patterns to meet the accessibility. The following ARIA attributes are used in the Blazor Rating component:

| Attributes | Purpose |
| ------------ | ----------------------- |
| `role=slider` | It defines an input where the user selects a value from within a specified range. |
| `role=button` | Specifies that the reset is a clickable element that resets the rating to its minimum value. |
| `aria-label` | Provides an accessible name for Rating. |
| `aria-valuemin` | It defines the minimum value of rating. |
| `aria-valuemax` | It defines the maximum value of rating. |
| `aria-valuenow` | It defines the current value of rating. |
| `aria-hidden` | It specifies whether the reset button is interactive or not. |

## Keyboard interaction

The Blazor Rating component followed the [keyboard interaction](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/slider/#keyboardinteraction) guideline, making it easy for people who use assistive technologies (AT) and those who completely rely on keyboard navigation. The following keyboard shortcuts are supported by the Blazor Rating component.

| Keyboard shortcuts | Actions |
|------------|-------------------|
| <kbd>Space</kbd> | When **Reset Button** is focused, resets to `min` value. |
| <kbd>Arrow Up</kbd> | Increases the value. |
| <kbd>Arrow Left</kbd> | Decreases the value; in RTL mode, increases the value. |
| <kbd>Arrow Down</kbd> | Decreases the value. |
| <kbd>Arrow Right</kbd> | Increases the value; in RTL mode, decreases the value. |
