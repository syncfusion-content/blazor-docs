## WAI-ARIA attributes

The Blazor Rating component follows the [WAI-ARIA slider pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/slider/) to meet accessibility requirements. The following ARIA attributes are used in the Blazor Rating component:

| Attributes | Purpose |
| ------------ | ----------------------- |
| `role=slider` | Defines an input where the user selects a value from within a specified range. |
| `role=button` | Indicates that the reset control is clickable and resets the rating to its minimum value. |
| `aria-label` | Provides an accessible name for the Rating component. |
| `aria-valuemin` | Defines the minimum rating value. |
| `aria-valuemax` | Defines the maximum rating value. |
| `aria-valuenow` | Announces the current rating value. |
| `aria-hidden` | Hides the element from assistive technologies when present. |

## Keyboard interaction

The Blazor Rating component follows the [keyboard interaction](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/slider/#keyboardinteraction) guideline, improving accessibility for people who use assistive technologies and those who rely on keyboard navigation. The following keyboard shortcuts are supported by the Blazor Rating component.

| Windows | Mac | Actions |
|------------|-------------------| ---|
| <kbd>Space</kbd> | <kbd>Space</kbd> | When the Reset button is focused, resets to the `min` value. |
| <kbd>↑</kbd> | <kbd>↑</kbd> | Increases the value. |
| <kbd>←</kbd> | <kbd>←</kbd> | Decreases the value; in right-to-left mode, increases the value. |
| <kbd>↓</kbd> | <kbd>↓</kbd> | Decreases the value. |
| <kbd>→</kbd> | <kbd>→</kbd> | Increases the value; in right-to-left mode, decreases the value. |
