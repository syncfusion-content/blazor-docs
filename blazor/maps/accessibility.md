# Accessibility in Blazor Maps Component

Maps has built-in accessibility features like screen reading, keyboard navigation, and WAI-ARIA attributes.

## WAI-ARIA attributes

To meet accessibility standards, the Maps component follows to the [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/alert/) patterns. In the Maps component, the following ARIA attributes are used:

| Attributes | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `role=region` | It specifies the Maps areas that do not support interactive functions like selection and highlight. |
| `role=button` | It specifies the Maps areas where interactive functions such as selection and highlight are available. |
| `aria-label` | Provides an accessible name for Maps elements such as geometric map shapes. To learn more, see the next topic. |

## Screen reading in Maps
