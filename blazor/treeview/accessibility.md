# Accessibility in Blazor TreeView Component

The [Blazor TreeView](https://www.syncfusion.com/blazor-components/blazor-treeview) component has been designed keeping in mind the [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/treeview/) specifications, and applies WAI-ARIA roles, states, and properties along with `keyboard support`. This component is characterized by complete keyboard interaction support and ARIA accessibility support that makes it easy for people who use assistive technologies (AT) and those who completely rely on keyboard navigation.

The Blazor TreeView component followed the accessibility guidelines and standards, including [ADA](https://www.ada.gov/), [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/), [WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) standards, and [WCAG roles](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#roles) that are commonly used to evaluate accessibility.

The accessibility compliance for the Blazor TreeView component is outlined below.

## Keyboard interaction

The Blazor TreeView component followed the [keyboard interaction](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/treeview/#keyboardinteraction) guideline, making it easy for people who use assistive technologies (AT) and those who completely rely on keyboard navigation.

| <kbd>Arrow Up</kbd> | Goes to the previous node. |
| <kbd>Arrow Down</kbd> | Goes to the next node. |
| <kbd>Arrow Right</kbd> | Expands the current node. |
| <kbd>Arrow Left</kbd> | Collapses the current node. |

| <kbd>End</kbd> | Goes to the last node. |
| <kbd>F2</kbd> | Edits the focused node. |
