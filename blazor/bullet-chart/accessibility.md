# Accessibility in Blazor Bullet Chart Component

Accessibility is achieved in the bullet chart component through WAI-ARIA standard. The bullet chart features can be effectively accessed through assistive technologies such as screen readers.

## WAI-ARIA

WAI-ARIA(Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications) defines a way to increase the accessibility of web pages, dynamic content, and user interface components developed with AJAX, HTML, Javascript, and related technologies. ARIA provides additional semantics to describe the role, state, and functionality of web components.

The following ARIA attributes are used in the bullet chart:

Element |Default description
-----|-----
Title |Reads the bullet chart's title.
Legend |Reads the range name.
Feature Measure Bar |Reads the target width and value height.
