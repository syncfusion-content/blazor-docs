# Security concerns in Blazor SpeechToText Component

## Online dependency

The Syncfusion Blazor SpeechToText component utilizes browser-based Web Speech APIs, which generally require an active internet connection to process speech data. This dependency introduces important security and privacy considerations that developers must address.

## Potential Security Risks

When using speech recognition technology, it is essential to be aware of the following potential security risks:

### Data Transmission to External Servers

Since speech-to-text processing is often handled by third-party services (e.g., Google, Microsoft), audio data is transmitted to external servers. This can expose sensitive spoken information to external entities.

### Privacy Concerns

Some speech recognition services may retain voice data for analytics or to improve their models. It is crucial to review the privacy policies of both the browser and the specific speech service being used.

### Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks

If the application is not served over HTTPS, attackers could intercept the audio data stream during transmission in a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack.

### Browser and Permission Exploits

A malicious website could misuse microphone permissions to eavesdrop on user conversations. Therefore, obtaining explicit user consent before accessing the microphone is a critical security measure.

## Mitigation Strategies

To ensure security and privacy when implementing speech recognition, adopt the following mitigation strategies:

* Use the component only in trusted environments.
* Inform users about third-party data processing.
* Enforce HTTPS to secure audio transmission.
* Request microphone permissions only when required and revoke them afterward.
* Review browser API privacy policies for speech recognition.
