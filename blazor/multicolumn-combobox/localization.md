## Localization

The [Blazor MultiColumn ComboBox](https://www.syncfusion.com/blazor-components/blazor-multicolumn-combobox) supports localization of built-in UI text (for example, messages such as “No records found” and “Action failure”). Refer to the [Blazor localization](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/common/localization) topic to localize Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> Blazor components.

## Globalization

Globalization is also supported. Dates, numbers, and other culture-sensitive values are formatted based on the current application culture. For guidance on configuring culture, number/date formats, and calendars, see the [Blazor globalization](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/common/globalization) documentation. For languages that read right-to-left, enable RTL rendering as described in [right-to-left support](../common/accessibility#right-to-left-support).
