# Accessibility in Blazor MultiColumn ComboBox Component

The [Blazor MultiColumn ComboBox](https://www.syncfusion.com/blazor-components/blazor-multicolumn-combobox) component has been designed with the `WAI-ARIA` specifications in mind, and applies the WAI-ARIA roles, states, and properties along with `keyboard support`. This component is characterized
by complete keyboard interaction support and ARIA accessibility support that makes it easy for people who use assistive technologies (AT) or those who completely rely on keyboard navigation.

The Blazor ComboBox component followed the accessibility guidelines and standards, including [ADA](https://www.ada.gov/), [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/), [WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) standards, and [WCAG roles](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#roles) that are commonly used to evaluate accessibility.

The accessibility compliance for the Blazor ComboBox component is outlined below.

| `aria-selected` | Indicates the selected option. |
| `aria-readonly` | Indicates the readonly state of the ComboBox element. |
| `aria-disabled` | Indicates whether the ComboBox component is in a disabled state or not. |
| `aria-activedescendent` | This attribute holds the ID of the active list item to focus its descendant child element. |
| `aria-owns` | This attribute contains the ID of the popup list to indicate popup as a child element. |
| `aria-autocomplete`  | This attribute contains the ‘both’ to a list of options shows and the currently selected suggestion also shows inline. |
