# Accessibility in Blazor Dropdown Tree Component

The [Blazor Dropdown Tree](https://www.syncfusion.com/blazor-components/blazor-dropdowntree) component has been designed, keeping in mind the [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/) specifications, and applied the WAI-ARIA roles, states, and properties along with `keyboard support`. This component is characterized by complete keyboard interaction support and ARIA accessibility support that makes it easy for people who use assistive technologies (AT) or those who completely rely on keyboard navigation.

The Blazor DropDown Tree component followed the accessibility guidelines and standards, including [ADA](https://www.ada.gov/), [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/), [WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) standards, and [WCAG roles](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#roles) that are commonly used to evaluate accessibility.

The accessibility compliance for the Blazor Dropdown Tree component is outlined below.
