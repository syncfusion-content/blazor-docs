# Syncfusion® Blazor AI Library Overview
The [Syncfusion Blazor AI](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Syncfusion.Blazor.AI) library provides robust AI integration for Blazor applications, enabling seamless connections to leading AI services such as [OpenAI](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-openai-api-key), [Azure OpenAI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/create-resource), [Ollama](https://ollama.com), and custom AI providers. This library forms the backbone for Syncfusion’s intelligent components, including the [Smart TextArea](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/smart-textarea/getting-started) and [Smart Paste Button](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/smart-paste/getting-started), empowering developers to build AI-enhanced applications. It offers text completion capabilities, delivering real-time suggestions, content generation, and intelligent text processing tailored to user input and application needs.

## Prerequisites
To use the Syncfusion Blazor AI library, ensure the following:
- Install the `Syncfusion.Blazor.AI` NuGet package.
- Obtain API keys for your chosen AI provider (e.g., OpenAI or Azure OpenAI).
- Configure the Blazor application to support HTTP requests for cloud-based AI services or local setup for Ollama.

## Key Features
- **Multi-Provider AI Support**:
  - Connects to popular AI services like OpenAI language models, Azure OpenAI, and Ollama local deployments.
  - Handles authentication, request formatting, and response processing for consistent performance across providers.
- **Custom AI Service Extensibility**:
  - Supports integration with proprietary or domain-specific AI models using defined interfaces.
  - Maintains compatibility with Syncfusion Blazor components for seamless extension.
- **Foundation for Smart UI Components**:
  - Enables context-aware suggestions and automated content generation in Syncfusion Blazor components.
  - Powers intelligent user assistance across the [Syncfusion Blazor ecosystem](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/demos/).

## Use Cases
- **Real-Time Text Suggestions**: Enhance text input fields with dynamic, context-aware suggestions.
- **Content Automation**: Generate reports, summaries, or responses based on user input.
- **Intelligent Text Processing**: Analyze and refine user input for improved clarity or formatting.

## Limitations
- Cloud-based AI services may have rate limits or require stable internet connectivity.
- Local models like Ollama demand sufficient hardware resources for optimal performance.
