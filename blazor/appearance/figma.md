## Customizing the UI kits

Here's how to customize the primary button color of the Material 3 theme within your layout:

4. Identify the button you wish to customize within your layout.

6. To customize this primary button control color, click outside the button to see the **Local variables** option on the right side of the Figma interface. It contains the design token for the color variables. Click the **Local variables** option.
7. A popup will show the design token list. You can change the primary color using a color palette.
8. Once you've selected the new color (e.g., pink) for the primary variable, the button's color pattern will be updated accordingly. You'll see the changes reflected in real-time within your design.
