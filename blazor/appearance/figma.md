## Customizing the UI kits

The Syncfusion Figma UI kits are easily customizable to meet your specific needs, allowing you to create unique designs and adjust colors to match your brand guidelines. The [atomic design methodology](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-2/) used in developing these controls, your customizations will be seamlessly reflected across multiple controls and their variants.

Here's how to customize the primary button color of the Material 3 theme within your layout:

1. Visit our [UI kits](#downloading-the-ui-kits) and choose your preferred theme, such as the Material 3 theme.
2. Open the selected theme in the Figma web application by clicking the **Open in Figma** button.
3. For the desktop application, click the **Import** button in the top-right corner of the page. Select the downloaded Syncfusion fig file you want to import and click the **Open** button.
4. Identify the button you wish to customize within your layout.
5. On the right side of the Figma interface, find the color variable options listed. For example, the variable for a particular button color might be labeled as `$primary-bg-color`, derived from the primary color variable.
6. To customize this primary button control color, click outside the button to see the **Local variables** option on the right side of the Figma interface. It contains the design token for the color variables. Click the **Local variables** option.
7. A popup will show the design token list. You can change the primary color using a color palette.
8. Once you've selected the new color (e.g., pink) for the primary variable, the button's color pattern will be updated accordingly. You'll see the changes reflected in real-time within your design.
