## WAI-ARIA attributes

The Blazor TextBox is characterized with complete ARIA Accessibility support that helps to access through the on-screen readers and other assistive technology devices. This component is designed with the reference of the guidelines document given in [WAI ARAI Accessibility practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#textbox).

The TextBox uses the `textbox` role and following ARIA properties for its element based on its state.

| **Property** | **Functionality** |
| --- | --- |
| aria-placeholder | The `aria-placeholder` is a short hint to help the users with data entry when the Textbox has no value. |
| aria-labelledby | The `aria-labelledby` property indicates the floating label element of the Textbox. |

## Ensuring accessibility

The Blazor TextBox component’s accessibility is validated with the [axe-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axe-core) tool during automated testing.

The accessibility compliance of the TextBox component is demonstrated in the following sample. Open the [accessibility sample for TextBox](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/accessibility/textbox) in a new window to evaluate accessibility with your preferred tools. The component also supports right-to-left (RTL) rendering and high-contrast themes for improved readability and usability.
