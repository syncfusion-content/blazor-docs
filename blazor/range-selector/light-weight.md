# Lightweight Range Selector in the Blazor Range Selector (SfRangeNavigator)

By default, when the [`DataSource`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.Charts.SfRangeNavigator.html#Syncfusion_Blazor_Charts_SfRangeNavigator_DataSource) for [`RangeNavigatorSeries`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.Charts.RangeNavigatorSeries.html) is empty, a lightweight Range Selector will be shown without Chart. The following code example shows the lightweight Range Selector.

{% aspTab template="range-navigator/light-weight", sourceFiles="light-weight.razor" %}

{% endaspTab %}
