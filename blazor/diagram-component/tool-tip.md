# Tooltip in Blazor Diagram Component

In a Graphical User Interface (GUI), a tooltip is a message that is displayed when the mouse is hovered over an element. The diagram provides tooltip support when dragging, resizing or rotating a node, and when the mouse hovers any diagram element.

## Default tooltip

By default, the diagram displays a tooltip that provides information about the size, position, and angle when dragging, resizing, and rotating diagram elements. The following images illustrate how the diagram displays the node information during an interaction.
