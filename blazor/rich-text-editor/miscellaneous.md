# Miscellaneous in Blazor RichTextEditor Component

## Character count

The Rich Text Editor automatically counts the number of characters in the content while typing, using the `ShowCharCount` property. The characters count displayed at the bottom of the editor. You can limit the number of characters in your content using the `MaxLength` property. By default, the editor sets the characters limit value to infinity.

The character count color will be modified based on the characters in the Rich Text Editor.

| Status | Description |
|----------------|---------|
| Normal | Till 70% of given maxLength count reach, character count color is black.|
| Warning | Once the number of character count in the Rich Text Editor reached 70% of given maxLength count, the character count color will be orange, indicating that, the Rich Text Editor value going to reach the maximum count.|
| Error | Once the number of character count in the Rich Text Editor reached 90% of given maxLength count, the character count color will be red, indicating that, the Rich Text Editor value reached the maximum count.|

### Specifying the Minimum and Maximum width and height for Resize

To have a restricted resizable area for the Rich Text Editor, you need to specify the min-width, max-width, min-height and max-height CSS properties for the control's container element. By default, the control is capable of resizing upto the current viewport. The `e-richtexteditor` CSS class will be available in the component's container and can be used for applying the above mentioned styles.

```css

<style>
  .e-richtexteditor {
      min-width: 200px;
      max-width: 800px;
      min-height: 100px;
      max-height: 300px;
  }
</style>

```
