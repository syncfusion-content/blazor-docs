# Image in Blazor RichTextEditor Component

Rich Text Editor allows inserting images from online sources and local computer where you want to insert the image in your content. For inserting the image to the Rich Text Editor, the following list of options have been provided in the `RichTextEditorImageSettings`.

| Options | Description |
|----------------|---------|
| AllowedTypes | Specifies the extensions of the image types allowed to insert on bowering and passing the extensions with List<string>. For example, private List<string> AllowedTypes = new List<string> { ".jpg",".png", ".gif" };|
| Display | Sets the default display for an image when it is inserted into the Rich Text Editor. Possible options are: `Inline` and `Break`.|
| Width | Sets the default width of the image when it is inserted in the Rich Text Editor.|
| Height | Sets the default height of the image when it is inserted in the Rich Text Editor.|
| SaveUrl | Provides URL to map the action result method to save the image.|
| Path | Specifies the location to store the image. It is of string type and it appends to the name of the file or folder where you want to store the image. For example, "api/Images/"|
| EnableResize | Enables resizing for image element.|
| MinWidth | Defines the minimum Width of the image.|
| MaxWidth | Defines the maximum Width of the image.|
| MinHeight | Defines the minimum Height of the image.|
| MaxHeight | Defines the maximum Height of the image.|
| ResizeByPercent | Image resizing should be done by percentage calculation.|

## Upload options

Through the `browse` option in the Image dialog, select the image from the local machine and insert into the Rich Text Editor content.

If the path field is not specified in the `RichTextEditorImageSettings`, the image will be converted into base64 and blob url for the image will be created then generated url will be set as `src` property of `<img>` tag as below.

The image has been loaded from the local machine and it will be saved in the given location.

```
<img src="blob:http://blazor.syncfusion.com/3ab56a6e-ec0d-490f-85a5-f0aeb0ad8879" >

```

N> If you want to insert a lot of tiny images in the editor and don't want a specific physical location for saving images, you can opt to save format as `Base64`.

## Server side action

The selected image can be uploaded to the required destination by using the following controller action. Map controller method name in `SaveUrl` property of `RichTextEditorImageSettings` and provide required destination path through `Path` property.

N> The following code block shows saving the image file uploaded to Rich Text Editor using the `Blazor Server App` project. The runnable Blazor Server app demo is available in this [Github](https://github.com/SyncfusionExamples/blazor-richtexteditor-image-upload) repository.
