# Accessibility in Blazor Toolbar Component

WAI-ARIA accessibility support is achieved through attributes like `aria-label` and `aria-orientation`, It provides information about elements in a document for assistive technology. The component implements keyboard navigation support by following the [WAI-ARIA practices](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/practices/), and has been tested in major screen readers.
