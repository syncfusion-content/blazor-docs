# Accessibility in Blazor Toolbar Component

The [Blazor Toolbar](https://www.syncfusion.com/blazor-components/blazor-toolbar) component has been designed, keeping in mind the [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/) specifications, and applying the WAI-ARIA roles, states and properties along with keyboard support for people who use assistive devices. WAI-ARIA accessibility support is achieved through attributes like `aria-orientation`, `aria-disabled` and `aria-haspopup`. It provides information about elements in a document for assistive technology. The component implements keyboard navigation support by following the [WAI-ARIA practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/), and has been tested in major screen readers.

## ARIA attributes

The Toolbar element is assigned the role of `toolbar`.

| **Property** | **Functionalities** |
| --- | --- |
| role="toolbar" | This attribute added to the ToolBar element describes the actual role of the element. |
| aria-orientation | Indicates the ToolBar orientation. Default value is `horizontal`. |
| aria-haspopup | Indicates the popup mode of the Toolbar. Default value is false. When popup mode is enabled, attribute value has to be changed to `true`. |
| aria-disabled | Indicates the disabled state of the ToolBar. |

## Keyboard interaction

Keyboard navigation is enabled, by default. Possible keys are:

| Key | Description |
|-------- | ------|
| <kbd>Left</kbd>    | Focuses the previous element. |
| <kbd>Right</kbd>   | Focuses the next element. |
| <kbd>Enter</kbd> | When focused on a ToolBar command, clicking the key triggers the click of Toolbar element. When popup drop-down icon is focused, the popup opens. |
| <kbd>Esc(Escape)</kbd> | Closes popup. |
