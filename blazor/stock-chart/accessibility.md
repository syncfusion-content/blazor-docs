# Accessibility in Blazor Stock Chart Component

Accessibility is achieved in the stock chart component through WAI-ARIA standard and keyboard navigation. The stock chart features can be effectively accessed through assistive technologies such as screen readers.

## WAI-ARIA

WAI-ARIA(Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications) defines a way to increase the accessibility of web pages, dynamic content, and user interface components developed with AJAX, HTML, Javascript, and related technologies. ARIA provides additional semantics to describe the role, state, and functionality of web components.

The following ARIA attributes are used in the Stock chart:

Element |Default description
-----|-----
Title |Reads the stock chart's title.
Legend |Reads the series name. 
Series Points |Reads the Point x : Point y value.
