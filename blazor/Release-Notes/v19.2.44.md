# Essential Studio for Blazor  Release Notes  

{% include release-info.html date="June 30, 2021"  version="v19.2.44" %} 

## Common

### New Features

- Built-in support added for Tailwind CSS theme with light and dark variants for Syncfusion Blazor components.

- Provided optional support to refer the component scripts externally from the application end to increase initial load performance. If `IgnoreScriptIsolation` is set to `true` in `AddSyncfusionBlazor()`, the Syncfusion Blazor components will disable the built-in script isolation and use application-level scripts.

	**Ways of adding external script references**
  
	1. The Syncfusion provides a combined script with all tools and major Blazor components by excluding Diagram, PDF Viewer, and Document Editor components

		```html
		<script  src="_content/Syncfusion.Blazor/scripts/syncfusion-blazor.min.js"  type="text/javascript"></script>
		```
	2. Refer to the CDN script reference below.
 
		```html
		<script  src="https://cdn.syncfusion.com/blazor/19.2.44/syncfusion-blazor.min.js"  type="text/javascript"></script>
		```
	3. Generate a required component script and styles from Blazor custom resource generator([Blazor CRG](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/crg)) and refer to them in your application.
