# Accessibility in Blazor Sidebar Component

The [Blazor Sidebar](https://www.syncfusion.com/blazor-components/blazor-sidebar) component followed the accessibility guidelines and standards, including [ADA](https://www.ada.gov/), [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/), [WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) standards, and [WCAG roles](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#roles) that are commonly used to evaluate accessibility.

The accessibility compliance for the Blazor Sidebar component is outlined below.

<div><img src="https://cdn.syncfusion.com/content/images/landing-page/yes.png" alt="Yes"> - All features of the component meet the requirement.</div>

<div><img src="https://cdn.syncfusion.com/content/images/documentation/partial.png" alt="Partial"> - Some features of the component do not meet the requirement.</div>

<div><img src="https://cdn.syncfusion.com/content/images/landing-page/no.png" alt="No"> - The component does not meet the requirement.</div>

## WAI-ARIA attributes

The Blazor Sidebar component followed the [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/) patterns to meet accessibility standards. By default, the Sidebar utilizes the [complementary](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/complementary_role) role, with the option to modify the ARIA role based on provided attributes to the root element, depending on the specific use case.

If there are multiple complementary landmark roles or aside elements in a document, it is important to provide a label for each landmark using the `aria-label` attribute. Alternatively, if the aside has a descriptive title, it can be referenced using the `aria-labelledby` attribute. This label will help assistive technology users quickly understand the purpose of each landmark.

For optimal accessibility, it is recommended to incorporate a trigger component that is navigable via a keyboard, such as a button. If this is not feasible, inclusion of the `tabIndex` attribute becomes necessary. Furthermore, explicit handling of the `aria-expanded` attribute is required for the trigger element.

## Keyboard interaction

The Blazor Sidebar component does not have any inbuilt keyboard interaction support. However, you can utilize the keyboard interactions of focusable elements within the Sidebar component.

## Ensuring accessibility

The Blazor Sidebar component's accessibility levels are ensured through an [axe-core](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Deque.AxeCore.Playwright) software tool during automated testing.

The accessibility compliance of the Sidebar component is shown in the following sample. Open the [sample](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/accessibility/sidebar) in a new window to evaluate the accessibility of the Sidebar component with accessibility tools.
