# Reset an image in the Blazor Image Editor component

The [ResetAsync](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.ImageEditor.SfImageEditor.html#Syncfusion_Blazor_ImageEditor_SfImageEditor_ResetAsync) method in the Image Editor control provides the capability to undo all changes made to an image and revert it to its original state. This method is particularly useful when multiple adjustments, annotations, or transformations have been applied to an image and a return to the original, unmodified version is required.

Invoking the `ResetAsync` method discards all modifications and restores the image to its initial state, enabling a clean restart of the editing process.
