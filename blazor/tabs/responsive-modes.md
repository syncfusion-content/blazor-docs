# Responsive Modes in Blazor Tabs Component

This section explains how the Blazor Tabs component handles scenarios where its width exceeds the available viewable area. The available overflow modes are as follows:

* Scrollable
* Popup

## Scrollable

The default [OverflowMode](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.Navigations.SfTab.html#Syncfusion_Blazor_Navigations_SfTab_OverflowMode) is `Scrollable`. This mode displays the Tab header items in a single line, enabling horizontal scrolling when items overflow the available space. Scrollable mode supports overflow for both horizontal (`Top`, `Bottom`) and vertical (`Left`, `Right`) `HeaderPlacement` configurations.

*   Right and left navigation arrows appear at the start and end of the Tab header, allowing users to navigate through overflowed items.
*   Overflowed items are also accessible via touch and swipe gestures on the header and content sections.
*   By default, the left navigation arrow is disabled. To view overflowed items, move in the right direction.
*   Clicking or holding an arrow continuously reveals the overflowed items.

* On devices, navigation arrows are not present. Instead, touch and swipe gestures reveal the overflowed Tab header items.

## Popup

The `Popup` is the another type of [OverflowMode](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.Navigations.SfTab.html#Syncfusion_Blazor_Navigations_SfTab_OverflowMode) in which the Tab container holds the items that can be placed within the available space. The rest of the overflowing items for which there is no space to fit within the viewing area are moved to overflow popup container.

* The items placed in popup can be viewed by opening the popup with the help of drop-down icon given at the end of the Tab header.

* If the popup's height exceeds the visible area, scroll through the popup items to select one.
