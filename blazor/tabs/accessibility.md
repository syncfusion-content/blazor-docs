# Accessibility in Blazor Tabs Component

The following list of attributes are added in the Tab.

| **Roles and Attributes** | **Functionalities** |

| tablist | This is set to role attribute in the Tab element that describes actual role of the element.|

| aria-orientation    | It indicates the Tab header orientation. Default value of this attribute is horizontal. |
| aria-activedescendant    | It indicates the current active child of the Tab component. |
| aria-haspopup       | It indicates the popup mode in the Tab. The default value of this attribute is false. If popup mode is enabled, the attribute value is set to true. |
| aria-disabled       | It indicates the disabled state of the Tab. |
| aria-selected       | It indicates the selection state for Tab items. Active Tab is set to true for this attribute. |
