# Add/Remove Tab items in Blazor Tabs Component

Tabs provides a support to add or remove the specified tab item using following ways.

* Using conditional rendering.
* Using public methods.

## Using conditional rendering

Tab items can be added or removed dynamically by iteration of tab items using conditional **foreach** loop.

In the following demo, initially there are three tabs as the **TabItems** has three items. On `Add Item` button click, new item is added to the **TabItems** results in adding fourth tab to the Tabs component. On clicking the `Remove Item`, the first item of **TabItems** has been removed which results in removing first tab of our Tabs component.

```cshtml
@using Syncfusion.Blazor.Navigations
@using Syncfusion.Blazor.Buttons

<SfButton @onclick="AddItemClick" Content="Add Item"></SfButton>
<SfButton @onclick="RemoveItemClick" Content="Remove Item"></SfButton>
<br />
<br />

<SfTab>
    <TabItems>
        @foreach (TabData Item in TabItems)
        {
            <TabItem>
                <HeaderTemplate>
                    <div>@(Item.Header)</div>
                </HeaderTemplate>
                <ContentTemplate>
                    <div>@(Item.Content)</div>
                </ContentTemplate>
            </TabItem>
        }
    </TabItems>
</SfTab>


@code {
    List<TabData> TabItems = new List<TabData>()
    {
        new TabData
        {
        Header = "ASP.NET",
        Content = "Microsoft ASP.NET is a set of technologies in the Microsoft .NET Framework for building Web applications and XML Web services.

ASP.NET pages use a compiled,event-driven programming model that improves performance and enables the separation of application logic and user interface."
        },
        new TabData
        {
        Header = "ASP.NET MVC",
        Content = "The Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern separates an application into three main components: the model, the view, and the controller.

        },

        }
    };
    public class TabData

            Content = "JavaScript (JS) is an interpreted computer programming language.It was originally implemented as part of web browsers so that client-side scripts could interact with the user, control the browser, communicate asynchronously, and alter the document content that was displayed."
        });
    }
    void RemoveItemClick()
    {
        if (TabItems.Count > 0)
        {
            TabItems.RemoveAt(0);
        }
    }

## Using public methods

Tabs can be added dynamically by passing list of items and index value to the `AddTab` method. The tab items can be removed by passing the specified item through `RemoveTab` method. Tab items can also be removed by clicking the close icon which appears on the tab header on setting true to `ShowCloseButton` property.

In the following demo, a tab item can be added as first tab and removed as the last tab item by clicking the **Add Tab** and **Remove Last Tab** buttons respectively.
