# Getting Started with Blazor Tabs Component

This section briefly explains about how to include [Blazor Tabs](https://www.syncfusion.com/blazor-components/blazor-tabs) component in your Blazor Server App and Blazor WebAssembly App using Visual Studio.

To get start quickly with Blazor Tabs, you can check on this video or [GitHub](https://github.com/SyncfusionExamples/Blazor-Getting-Started-Examples/tree/main/Tabs) sample:

{% youtube
"youtube:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OgywAA_XHg"%}

## Prerequisites

* [System requirements for Blazor components](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/system-requirements)

## Create a new Blazor App in Visual Studio

You can create a **Blazor Server App** or **Blazor WebAssembly App** using Visual Studio via [Microsoft Templates](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/tooling?view=aspnetcore-7.0) or the [Syncfusion Blazor Extension](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/visual-studio-integration/template-studio).

## Install Syncfusion Blazor Navigations and Theme NuGet in the App

To add Blazor Tabs component in the app, open the NuGet package manager in Visual Studio (*Tools → NuGet Package Manager → Manage NuGet Packages for Solution*), search and install [Syncfusion.Blazor.Navigations](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Syncfusion.Blazor.Navigations/) and [Syncfusion.Blazor.Themes](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Syncfusion.Blazor.Themes/). Alternatively, you can utilize the following package manager command to achieve the same.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight C# tabtitle="Package Manager" %}

Install-Package Syncfusion.Blazor.Navigations -Version {{ site.releaseversion }}

Install-Package Syncfusion.Blazor.Themes -Version {{ site.releaseversion }}

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

N> Syncfusion Blazor components are available in [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=syncfusion.blazor). Refer to [NuGet packages](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/nuget-packages) topic for available NuGet packages list with component details.

## Register Syncfusion Blazor Service

Open **~/_Imports.razor** file and import the `Syncfusion.Blazor` and `Syncfusion.Blazor.Navigations` namespace.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight razor tabtitle="~/_Imports.razor" %}

@using Syncfusion.Blazor
@using Syncfusion.Blazor.Navigations

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

Now, register the Syncfusion Blazor Service in the **~/Program.cs** file of your Blazor Server App or Blazor WebAssembly App. 

{% tabs %}
{% highlight C# tabtitle="Blazor Server App" hl_lines="3 10" %}

using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web;
using Syncfusion.Blazor;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Add services to the container.
builder.Services.AddRazorPages();
builder.Services.AddServerSideBlazor();
builder.Services.AddSyncfusionBlazor();

var app = builder.Build();
....

{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight C# tabtitle="Blazor WebAssembly App" hl_lines="3 11" %}

using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.Web;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Hosting;
using Syncfusion.Blazor;

var builder = WebAssemblyHostBuilder.CreateDefault(args);
builder.RootComponents.Add<App>("#app");
builder.RootComponents.Add<HeadOutlet>("head::after");

builder.Services.AddScoped(sp => new HttpClient { BaseAddress = new Uri(builder.HostEnvironment.BaseAddress) });

builder.Services.AddSyncfusionBlazor();
await builder.Build().RunAsync();
....

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

## Add stylesheet and script resources

The theme stylesheet and script can be accessed from NuGet through [Static Web Assets](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/appearance/themes#static-web-assets). Reference the stylesheet and script in the `<head>` of the main page as follows: 

* For **.NET 6** Blazor Server app, include it in **~/Pages/_Layout.cshtml** file.

* For **.NET 7** Blazor Server app, include it in the **~/Pages/_Host.cshtml** file.

* For Blazor WebAssembly app, include it in the **~/index.html** file.

```html
<head>
    ....
    <link href="_content/Syncfusion.Blazor.Themes/bootstrap5.css" rel="stylesheet" />
    <script src="_content/Syncfusion.Blazor.Core/scripts/syncfusion-blazor.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
</head>
```
N> Check out the [Blazor Themes](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/appearance/themes) topic to discover various methods ([Static Web Assets](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/appearance/themes#static-web-assets), [CDN](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/appearance/themes#cdn-reference), and [CRG](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/common/custom-resource-generator)) for referencing themes in your Blazor application. Also, check out the [Adding Script Reference](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/common/adding-script-references) topic to learn different approaches for adding script references in your Blazor application.

## Add Blazor Tabs component

Add the Syncfusion Blazor Tabs component in the **~/Pages/Index.razor** file.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight razor %}

## Initialize Blazor Tab Content using Template

Tab provides support to render content using `ContentTemplate` property. You can give preferred content inside the `ContentTemplate` element.

N> `ContentTemplate` property supports `RenderFragment` type to render content.

The following code explains how to initialize tab content using `ContentTemplate`.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight razor %}

<SfTab>
    <TabItems>
        <TabItem>
            <ChildContent>
                <TabHeader Text="HTML"></TabHeader>
            </ChildContent>
            <ContentTemplate>
                <div>HyperText Markup Language, commonly referred to as HTML, is the standard markup language used to create web pages. Along with CSS, and JavaScript, HTML is a cornerstone technology, used by most websites to create visually engaging web pages, user interfaces for web applications, and user interfaces for many mobile applications.[1] Web browsers can read HTML files and render them into visible or audible web pages. HTML describes the structure of a website semantically along with cues for presentation, making it a markup language, rather than a programming language.</div>
            </ContentTemplate>
        </TabItem>
        <TabItem>
            <ChildContent>
                <TabHeader Text="Java"></TabHeader>
            </ChildContent>
            <ContentTemplate>
                <div>Java is a set of computer software and specifications developed by Sun Microsystems, later acquired by Oracle Corporation, that provides a system for developing application software and deploying it in a cross-platform computing environment. Java is used in a wide variety of computing platforms from embedded devices and mobile phones to enterprise servers and supercomputers. While less common, Java applets run in secure, sandboxed environments to provide many features of native applications and can be embedded in HTML pages.</div>
            </ContentTemplate>
        </TabItem>
        <TabItem>
            <ChildContent>
                <TabHeader Text="JavaScript"></TabHeader>

            <ContentTemplate>@DynamicContent</ContentTemplate>
        </TabItem>
    </TabItems>
</SfTab>

@code{
    public RenderFragment DynamicContent = builder =>
    {
        builder.AddContent(1, "JavaScript (JS) is an interpreted computer programming language. It was originally implemented as part of web browsers so that client-side scripts could interact with the user, control the browser, communicate asynchronously, and alter the document content that was displayed.[5] More recently, however, it has become common in both game development and the creation of desktop applications.");
    };
}

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

## Two way binding of SelectedItem

The property [SelectedItem](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.Navigations.SfTab.html#Syncfusion_Blazor_Navigations_SfTab_SelectedItem) supports two way property binding, in the following code example if either the value is changed in numeric text box or selected tab item is changed, it will reflect in both the value of numeric text box and selected tab item.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight razor %}

@using Syncfusion.Blazor.Inputs
@using Syncfusion.Blazor.Navigations

Selected Tab
<SfNumericTextBox TValue="int" @bind-Value="@SelectedTab" Min="0" Max="4" Width="200px"></SfNumericTextBox>

<SfTab @bind-SelectedItem="SelectedTab">
