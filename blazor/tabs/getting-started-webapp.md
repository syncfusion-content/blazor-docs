# Getting Started with Blazor Tabs in Blazor Web App

This section briefly explains about how to include [Blazor Tabs](https://www.syncfusion.com/blazor-components/blazor-tabs) component in your Blazor Web App using [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/).

## Prerequisites

* [System requirements for Blazor components](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/system-requirements)

## Create a new Blazor Web App

You can create a **Blazor Web App** using Visual Studio 2022 via [Microsoft Templates](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/tooling?view=aspnetcore-8.0) or the [Syncfusion Blazor Extension](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/visual-studio-integration/template-studio).

You need to configure the corresponding [Interactive render mode](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/components/render-modes?view=aspnetcore-8.0#render-modes) and [Interactivity location](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/tooling?view=aspnetcore-8.0&pivots=windows) while creating a Blazor Web Application.

## Install Syncfusion Blazor Navigations and Themes NuGet in the App

To add **Blazor Tabs** component in the app, open the NuGet package manager in Visual Studio (*Tools → NuGet Package Manager → Manage NuGet Packages for Solution*), search and install [Syncfusion.Blazor.Navigations](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Syncfusion.Blazor.Navigations/) and [Syncfusion.Blazor.Themes](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Syncfusion.Blazor.Themes/).

If you utilize `WebAssembly or Auto` render modes in the Blazor Web App need to be install Syncfusion Blazor components NuGet packages within the client project.

Alternatively, you can utilize the following package manager command to achieve the same.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight C# tabtitle="Package Manager" %}

Install-Package Syncfusion.Blazor.Navigations -Version {{ site.releaseversion }}
Install-Package Syncfusion.Blazor.Themes -Version {{ site.releaseversion }}

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

N> Syncfusion Blazor components are available in [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=syncfusion.blazor). Refer to [NuGet packages](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/nuget-packages) topic for available NuGet packages list with component details.

## Register Syncfusion Blazor Service

Open **~/_Imports.razor** file and import the `Syncfusion.Blazor` and `Syncfusion.Blazor.Navigations` namespace .

```cshtml

@using Syncfusion.Blazor
@using Syncfusion.Blazor.Navigations

```

Now, register the Syncfusion Blazor Service in the **~/Program.cs** file of your Blazor Web App.

If you select an **Interactive render mode** as `WebAssembly` or `Auto`, you need to register the Syncfusion Blazor service in both **~/Program.cs** files of your Blazor Web App.

```cshtml

....
using Syncfusion.Blazor;
....
builder.Services.AddSyncfusionBlazor();
....

```

## Add stylesheet and script resources

The theme stylesheet and script can be accessed from NuGet through [Static Web Assets](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/appearance/themes#static-web-assets). Include the stylesheet reference in the `<head>` section and the script reference at the end of the `<body>` in the **~/Components/App.razor** file as shown below:

```html
<head>
    ....
    <link href="_content/Syncfusion.Blazor.Themes/bootstrap5.css" rel="stylesheet" />
</head>

<body>
    ....
    <script src="_content/Syncfusion.Blazor.Core/scripts/syncfusion-blazor.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
</body>
```

N> Check out the [Blazor Themes](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/appearance/themes) topic to discover various methods ([Static Web Assets](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/appearance/themes#static-web-assets), [CDN](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/appearance/themes#cdn-reference), and [CRG](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/common/custom-resource-generator)) for referencing themes in your Blazor application. Also, check out the [Adding Script Reference](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/common/adding-script-references) topic to learn different approaches for adding script references in your Blazor application.

## Add Syncfusion Blazor Tabs component

Add the Syncfusion Blazor Tabs component in the **~Pages/.razor** file. If an interactivity location as `Per page/component` in the web app, define a render mode at the top of the `~Pages/.razor` component, as follows:

{% tabs %}
{% highlight razor %}

@* desired render mode define here *@
@rendermode InteractiveAuto

{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

{% tabs %}
{% highlight razor %}

## Initialize Blazor Tab Content using Template

Tab provides support to render content using `ContentTemplate` property. You can give preferred content inside the `ContentTemplate` element.

N> `ContentTemplate` property supports `RenderFragment` type to render content.

The following code explains how to initialize tab content using `ContentTemplate`.

                <div>HyperText Markup Language, commonly referred to as HTML, is the standard markup language used to create web pages. Along with CSS, and JavaScript, HTML is a cornerstone technology, used by most websites to create visually engaging web pages, user interfaces for web applications, and user interfaces for many mobile applications.[1] Web browsers can read HTML files and render them into visible or audible web pages. HTML describes the structure of a website semantically along with cues for presentation, making it a markup language, rather than a programming language.</div>

It was originally implemented as part of web browsers so that client-side scripts could interact with the user, control the browser, communicate asynchronously, and alter the document content that was displayed.[5] More recently, however, it has become common in both game development and the creation of desktop applications.</div>

## Two way binding of SelectedItem

The property [SelectedItem](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.Navigations.SfTab.html#Syncfusion_Blazor_Navigations_SfTab_SelectedItem) supports two way property binding, in the following code example if either the value is changed in numeric text box or selected tab item is changed, it will reflect in both the value of numeric text box and selected tab item.

{% tabs %}
