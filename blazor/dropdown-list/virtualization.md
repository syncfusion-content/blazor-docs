# Virtualization in DropDown List

The DropDownList component includes a virtual scrolling feature designed to enhance UI performance, particularly for handling large datasets. By enabling the [EnableVirtualization](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.DropDowns.SfDropDownList-2.html#Syncfusion_Blazor_DropDowns_SfDropDownList_2_EnableVirtualization) option, the DropDownList intelligently manages data rendering, ensuring only a subset of items is initially loaded when the component is rendered. As you interact with the dropdown, additional items are dynamically loaded as you scroll, creating a smooth and efficient user experience.

This feature is applicable to both local and remote data scenarios, providing flexibility in its implementation. For instance, consider a case where the DropDownList is bound to a dataset containing 150 items. Upon opening the dropdown, only a few items are loaded initially, based on the height of the popup. As you scroll through the list, additional items are fetched and loaded on-demand, allowing you to effortlessly explore the complete dataset.

## Grouping with Virtualization

The DropDownList component supports grouping with Virtualization. It allows you to organize elements into groups based on different categories. Each item in the list can be classified using the [DropDownListFieldSettings.GroupBy](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.DropDowns.DropDownListFieldSettings.html#Syncfusion_Blazor_DropDowns_DropDownListFieldSettings_GroupBy) field in the data table. After grouping, virtualization works similarly to local data binding, providing a seamless user experience. When the data source is bound to remote data, an initial request is made to retrieve all data for the purpose of grouping. Subsequently, the grouped data works in the same way as local data binding on virtualization. 

The following sample shows the example for Grouping with Virtualization.

## Keyboard interaction

Users can navigate through the scrollable content using keyboard actions. This feature loads the next or next set of items based on the key inputs in the popup.

| Key | Action |
|-----|-----|
| `ArrowDown` | Loads the next virtual list item if the selection is present in last item of the current page. |
| `ArrowUp` | Loads the previous virtual list item if the selection is present in first item of the current page. |
| `PageDown` | Loads the next page and selects the last item in it. |
| `PageUp` | Loads the previous page and selects the first item in it. |
| `Home` | Loads the initial set of items and selects first item in it. |
| `End` | Loads the last set of items and selects last item in it. |
