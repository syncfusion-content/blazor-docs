## WAI-ARIA attributes

The following ARIA attributes are recommended for the Blazor Block Editor to improve discoverability and operable by assistive technologies.

| Attribute | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `contenteditable="true"` + `role="textbox"` | Marks the editable block container as an editable text region. The editable region must have an accessible name to satisfy input-field-name checks. |
| `role="toolbar"` | Applied to inline formatting toolbars and action-menu containers to group related controls for assistive technologies. |
| `role="grid"` | Table blocks are exposed as a grid/table for screen readers and keyboard navigation; ensure header cells (`th`) and proper `scope`/`headers` attributes are present. |
| `role="img"` | Ensure accessible name is present for informative images. |
| `aria-label` / `aria-labelledby` | Provides the accessible name for the editor, toolbar, or specific editable region. The running sample is missing this on the main editable container (axe reports `aria-input-field-name`). |
| `aria-orientation` | Specifies the orientation of the toolbar. |
| `aria-disabled` | Indicates whether the toolbar or element is currently disabled and not interactive. |
| `aria-haspopup` / `aria-expanded` | Used by menus and popups (command/context/action menus). `aria-expanded` reflects open/closed state. |
| `aria-hidden` | Hides non-interactive or offscreen content (e.g., closed popups) from assistive technologies. |

## Keyboard interaction

The Blazor Block Editor component follows [keyboard interaction](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/alert/#keyboardinteraction) guidelines, making it easy for people who use assistive technologies (AT) or rely solely on keyboard navigation. The component supports a variety of keyboard shortcuts for common actions.

For a complete list of keyboard shortcuts, refer to the [Keyboard Support](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/block-editor/keyboard-shortcuts) documentation.

## Ensuring accessibility

The Blazor Block Editor component's accessibility levels are ensured through an [axe-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axe-core) software tool during automated testing.
