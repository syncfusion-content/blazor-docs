{% aspTab template="tree-grid/clip-board/copy", sourceFiles="index.razor,treegriddata.cs" %}

{% endaspTab %}

## Copy to clipboard by external buttons

To copy selected rows or cells data into the clipboard with help of external buttons, you need to invoke the `copy` method.

{% aspTab template="tree-grid/clip-board/copyButtons", sourceFiles="index.razor,treegriddata.cs" %}

{% endaspTab %}

## Copy Hierarchy Modes

Tree Grid provides support for a set of copy modes with `CopyHierarchyMode` property.
The below are the type of filter mode available in Tree Grid.

* **Parent** : This is the default copy hierarchy mode in Tree Grid. Clipboard value will have the selected records with its parent records, if the selected records not have any parent record then the selected record will be in clipboard.

* **Child** : Clipboard value will have the selected records with its child record. If the selected records do not have any child record then the selected records will be in clipboard.

* **Both** : Clipboard value will have the selected records with its both parent and child record. If the selected records do not have any parent and child record then the selected records alone are copied to clipboard.

* **None** : Only the Selected records will be in clipboard.

{% aspTab template="tree-grid/clip-board/hierarchy", sourceFiles="index.razor,treegriddata.cs" %}

{% endaspTab %}

## AutoFill

AutoFill Feature allows you to copy the data of selected cells and paste it to another cells by just dragging the autofill icon of the selected cells up to required cells. This feature is enabled by defining `EnableAutoFill` property as true.

{% aspTab template="tree-grid/clip-board/autofill", sourceFiles="index.razor,treegriddata.cs" %}

{% endaspTab %}

> * If `EnableAutoFill` is set to true, then the autofill icon will be displayed on cell selection to copy cells.
> * It requires the selection `Mode` to be `Cell`,  `CellSelectionMode` to be `Box` and also Batch Editing should be enabled.

### Limitations of AutoFill

* Since the string values are not parsed to number and date type, so when the selected string type cells are dragged to number type cells then it will display as **NaN**. For date type cells, when the selected string type cells are dragged to date type cells then it will display as an **empty cell**.
* Linear series and the sequential data generations are not supported in this autofill feature.
