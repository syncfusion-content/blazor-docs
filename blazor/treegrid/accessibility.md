# Accessibility in Blazor TreeGrid Component

The Tree Grid component followed the accessibility guidelines and standards, including [ADA](https://www.ada.gov/), [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/), [WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) standards, and [WCAG roles](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#roles) that are commonly used to evaluate accessibility.

The accessibility compliance for the Tree Grid component is outlined below.

## WAI-ARIA

The Tree Grid component followed the [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/treegrid/) patterns to meet the accessibility. The following ARIA attributes are used in the Tree Grid component:

| Attributes | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `role=treegrid` | Used to convey a significant and contextual message to the user. |
| `aria-selected` | Accurately reflect the selection state, whether it's single-select or multi-select. |
| `aria-expanded` | It can be used to show whether a node is expanded or collapsed, making it easier for screen reader users to navigate and understand the hierarchy. |
| `aria-sort` | Indicate the current sorting order of a table column for users with disabilities, facilitating accessible data presentation and interaction. |
| `aria-busy` |  Loading state to improve accessibility for users, particularly those relying on screen readers. |
| `aria-invalid` | To indicate whether the user's input in a form field is valid or invalid, aiding users, including those with disabilities, in understanding and correcting their input. |
| `aria-grabbed` | Provides accessibility information for users interacting with draggable elements |
| `aria-owns` | Establishing relationships between an element and the elements it owns or controls. |
| `aria-label` | Provides an accessible name for the close icon. |

## Keyboard interaction

The Tree Grid component followed the [keyboard interaction](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/treegrid/) guideline, making it easy for people who use assistive technologies (AT) and those who completely rely on keyboard navigation. The following keyboard shortcuts are supported by the Tree Grid component.

## Ensuring accessibility

The Tree Grid component's accessibility levels are ensured through an [accessibility-checker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/accessibility-checker) and [axe-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axe-core) software tools during automated testing.

The accessibility compliance of the Tree Grid component is shown in the following sample. Open the [sample](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/accessibility/treegrid) in a new window to evaluate the accessibility of the Tree Grid component with accessibility tools.
