# Access public method in Tree Grid

You can access the public methods available in the Tree Grid component by using its reference defined in the component initialization.

This is demonstrated in the below sample code where the [`Print`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.TreeGrid.SfTreeGrid-1.html#Syncfusion_Blazor_TreeGrid_SfTreeGrid_1_Print) method of the Tree Grid component is invoked on button click using the Tree Grid reference,

{% aspTab template="tree-grid/how-to/public-method", sourceFiles="index.razor,treegriddata.cs" %}

{% endaspTab %}

> Similarly all the public methods of the Tree Grid can be invoked. The available public methods can be found in this [`link`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.TreeGrid.SfTreeGrid-1.html).
