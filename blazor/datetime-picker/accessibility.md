# Accessibility in Blazor Datetime Picker Component

The web accessibility defines a way to make web content and web applications more accessible to disabled people. It especially helps the dynamic content change and advanced user interface components developed with Ajax, HTML, JavaScript, and related technologies.

The [Blazor DateTimePicker](https://www.syncfusion.com/blazor-components/blazor-datetime-picker) component followed the accessibility guidelines and standards, including [ADA](https://www.ada.gov/), [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/), [WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) standards, and [WCAG roles](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#roles) that are commonly used to evaluate accessibility.

The accessibility compliance for the Blazor DateTimePicker component is outlined below.

## WAI-ARIA attributes

Blazor DateTimePicker provides built-in compliance with the [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/) specifications. `WAI-ARIA` support is achieved through the attributes like `aria-expanded`, `aria-disabled`, `aria-activedescendant` applied to the input element.

To learn about the accessibility of Calendar, refer to the Calendar's [Accessibility](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/calendar/accessibility) section.

It helps to provide information about the widget for assistive technology to the disabled person in screen reader.

* **aria-expanded**: Attribute indicates the state of a collapsible element.

* **aria-disabled**: Attribute indicates the disabled state of this DateTimePicker component.

* **aria-activedescendent**: Attribute helps in managing the current active child of the DateTimePicker component.
