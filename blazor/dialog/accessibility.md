# Accessibility in Blazor Dialog Component

The Dialog is characterized with complete ARIA Accessibility support which makes it accessible to on-screen readers and other assistive technology devices. This component is designed with the reference of the guidelines document given in [WAI ARAI Accessibility Practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#dialog_modal).

The Dialog component uses the `Dialog` role and following ARIA properties to its element based on its state.

| **Property** | **Functionalities** |
| --- | --- |
| aria-describedby | Indicates that the Dialog content description is notified to the users through assistive technologies. |
| aria-labelledby | The Dialog title is notified to the users through assistive technologies. |
| aria-modal | For modal dialog, it's value is true and non-modal dialog its value is false |
| aria-grabbed | Enables the draggable Dialog and starts dragging if its value is true and stops dragging if its value is false. |
