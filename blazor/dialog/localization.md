# Localization in Blazor Dialog Component

The [Blazor Dialog](https://www.syncfusion.com/blazor-components/blazor-modal-dialog) supports localization so that built-in UI text (such as the close button tooltip) and any developer-provided content can appear in the userâ€™s language. Refer to the [Blazor localization](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/common/localization) guide for configuring localization across Syncfusion Blazor components.
