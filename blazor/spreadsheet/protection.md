# Protect Sheet and Workbook in Blazor Spreadsheet component

Protection features in the Blazor Spreadsheet component safeguard data by restricting unauthorized modifications to sheets and workbooks. Sheet protection prevents accidental changes to cell content, while workbook protection limits structural modifications, such as inserting or renaming sheets. Both features support optional password protection and customizable permissions for specific actions, ensuring flexibility and security based on application requirements.

## Protect sheet

Sheet protection restricts modifications to a sheetâ€™s content, such as editing or deleting data. Specific actions, like cell selection, filtering, sorting or formatting, can be permitted through configuration settings. Protection can be applied with or without a password, depending on the desired security level.

### Protecting sheets via UI

Sheet protection can be enabled through the user interface in the active sheet using one of the following methods:

* Select **Protect Sheet** from the **Review** tab in the Ribbon toolbar and choose the desired options.

* Right-click the sheet tab context menu option, select **Protect Sheet** from the context menu, and choose the desired options.

The dialog allows setting an optional password and selecting permitted actions.

### Unlock specific cells or ranges

Specific cells or ranges in a protected sheet can be unlocked to allow editing while maintaining restrictions on the rest of the sheet. This feature supports scenarios where selective data editing is required.

To unlock specific cells or ranges in a protected sheet, follow these steps:

* Open the **Protect Sheet** dialog from the **Review** tab or the sheet tab context menu.

* Navigate to the **Unlock Range** tab in the dialog.

* Select the desired cells or ranges that should remain editable.

* Confirm the settings and apply protection to the sheet.

The selected cells or ranges remain editable, while the rest of the sheet remains protected. Copying a locked cell is permitted. However, cutting and pasting are only allowed for unlocked cells.

### Protection settings in a protected sheet

When a sheet is protected, most actions, such as formatting, inserting, sorting, and filtering, are restricted by default. However, specific actions can be enabled through the protection settings to allow controlled interaction with the sheet.

To enable specific functionalities while the sheet is protected:

* Open the **Protect Sheet** dialog from the **Review** tab.

* Go to the **Sheet Options** tab to view available protection settings.

* Select or deselect the desired options to allow or restrict specific actions.

* Click **OK** to apply the protection settings.

The available protection settings in Spreadsheet component include:

| Options | Description |
|------------------------|---------|
| Select Locked Cells | Permits selection of locked cells in the protected sheet. This option cannot be enabled alone. Enabling it automatically enables the option to select unlocked cells. |
| Select UnLocked Cells | Permits selection of unlocked cells in the protected sheet. |
| Format Cells | Permits formatting of cells, such as changing fonts or colors. |
| Format Rows | Permits formatting of rows, such as adjusting row height. |

## Unprotect Sheet

Unprotecting a sheet removes restrictions on actions previously limited by protection. After unprotecting, the sheet allows full interaction, including editing, formatting, inserting, and deleting content.

To unprotect a sheet, follow one of these methods:

* Select **Unprotect Sheet** from the **Review** tab in the Ribbon toolbar.

* Right-click the sheet tab context menu option and select **Unprotect Sheet** from the context menu, and enter the password if prompted.

If a password was set during protection, the correct password must be entered to unprotect the sheet.

## Protect Workbook

The **Protect Workbook** support restricts structural modifications within a workbook. Actions such as inserting, deleting, renaming, or hiding sheets are disabled when this protection is enabled. Protection can be configured with or without a password, depending on the desired level of security.

### Protecting workbooks via UI

To protect the workbook, follow these steps:

* Go to the **Review** tab in the Ribbon toolbar.
