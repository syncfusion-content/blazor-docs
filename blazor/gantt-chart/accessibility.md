The following ARIA attributes are used in Blazor Gantt:

| `gridcell (role)` | This attribute is added to the `td` elements present within the `e-table`, which represents the work cells of Gantt .|
| `columnheader (role)` | This attribute is added to the `th` elements within the `e-table`, which represents the header cells of Grid table. |
| `separator (role)` | This attribute is added to the `e-split-bar` element, which represents the splitter between the Grid table and Chart. |
| `dialog (role)` | This attribute is added to the `e-dialog` element, which represents the pop-up dialog. |
| `toolbar (role)` | This attribute is added to the `e-gantt-toolbar` element, which represents the toolbars of Gantt. |
