## WAI-ARIA

The Gantt component followed the [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/) patterns to meet the accessibility. The following ARIA attributes are used in the Gantt component:

The following ARIA attributes are used in Gantt:


| **Attributes** | **Description** |

| `gridcell (role)` | This attribute is added to the `td` elements present within the `e-table`, which represents the work cells of Gantt .|
| `columnheader (role)` | This attribute is added to the `th` elements within the `e-table`, which represents the header cells of Grid table. |

## Ensuring accessibility

The Gantt component's accessibility levels are ensured through an [accessibility-checker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/accessibility-checker) and [axe-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axe-core) software tools during automated testing.

The accessibility compliance of the Gantt component is shown in the following sample. Open the [sample](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/accessibility/gantt-chart) in a new window to evaluate the accessibility of the Gantt component with accessibility tools.
