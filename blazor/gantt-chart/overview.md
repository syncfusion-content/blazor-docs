# Index in Blazor Gantt component

The Gantt Chart in Blazor offers a project management interface similar to Microsoft Project, designed for scheduling and managing projects. It provides an intuitive way to visually manage tasks, their relationships, and project resources.

## Key features

**1. Data & Handling** 
Supports flexible data integration and efficient processing through structured field mapping, remote data connectivity, and performance-optimized rendering for large datasets.
   * [Data Binding](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/gantt-chart/data-binding): The Gantt component supports both **hierarchical** and **self-referential** JSON structures. It also integrates seamlessly with remote data sources using the DataManager component, enabling RESTful API connections, OData, and other services. This flexibility allows dynamic data loading. 
   * [Task Field Mapping](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/gantt-chart/getting-started-with-web-app#binding-gantt-chart-with-data-and-mapping-task-fields): Maps specific data fields to Gantt chart properties using the `GanttTaskFields` configuration. Required fields include id, name, and startDate, with optional fields like duration, progress, and parentID to define task hierarchy and scheduling.
   * [Large Data](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/gantt-chart/data-binding#load-child-on-demand): Optimized for large datasets using **virtualization** and **load-on-demand** techniques. Improves performance by rendering only visible rows and timeline cells during scroll operations.

**2. Task Management** 
Provides comprehensive tools for creating, scheduling, and modifying tasks, including support for dependencies,  milestones, and dynamic updates to reflect real-time project changes.
  * [Tasks](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/gantt-chart/scheduling-tasks): Supports both scheduled and unscheduled tasks. Scheduled tasks include start and end dates, durations, and dependencies, with flexible duration units such as days, hours, or minutes. Unscheduled tasks can be defined with only one or none of these values, allowing placeholders or milestones to be represented without fixed dates. This setup enables precise control over task planning and visibility within the project timeline.
  * [Milestones](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/gantt-chart/scheduling-tasks#milestone): Represents tasks with zero duration that require both a start and end date. Milestones are used to mark key events in the project and are included in the timeline, impacting scheduling and progress tracking.
  * [Split Tasks](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/gantt-chart/split-task#split-and-merge-tasks-dynamically) : Allows tasks to be divided into segments with gaps, useful for modeling interruptions or phased work.
  * [Editing](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/gantt-chart/editing-tasks): Task details can be modified using different methods such as cell editing, dialog forms, and taskbar adjustments. Tasks can be changed by entering new values or by dragging and resizing directly on the timeline. 
  * [Row Drag/Drop](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/gantt-chart/resource-view#taskbar-drag-and-drop-between-resources): Allows tasks to be reordered or moved to a different position within the task hierarchy using drag-and-drop actions. 
  * [Dependencies](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/gantt-chart/task-dependencies): Defines relationships between tasks to control their sequence and timing. Supports standard dependency types such as Finish-to-Start (FS), Start-to-Finish (SF), Start-to-Start (SS), and Finish-to-Finish (FF). These relationships help maintain logical task flow and ensure accurate scheduling.
  * [Critical Path](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/gantt-chart/criticalpath): Identifies and highlights tasks that directly affect the overall project completion timeline, aiding in risk and delay analysis.
  * [Auto-Scheduling](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/gantt-chart/scheduling-tasks#automatically-scheduled-tasks): Automatically adjusts task start and end dates based on dependencies, constraints, working hours, holidays, and weekends. When enabled, parent tasks are scheduled according to the earliest start and latest end dates of their child tasks. Any updates to child tasks will automatically reflect in the parent taskâ€™s schedule and progress.
