If you need to install our demos in the Documents folder, follow the steps in this [link](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/allow-an-app-to-access-controlled-folders-b5b6627a-b008-2ca2-7931-7e51e912b034) and disable the controlled folder access.
3.	You can enable this option after the installing our Syncfusion setup.

**Suggestion 2:** <br /> 1.	If you do not want to disable controlled folder access, you can install our demos in another directory.
