# Include the Authorization token in Blazor PDF Viewer Component

The Syncfusion's Blazor PDF Viewer component allows to include the authorization token in the PDF viewer AJAX request using the properties of the ajaxRequest header available in [`AjaxRequestSettings`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.PdfViewer.PdfViewerBase.html#Syncfusion_Blazor_PdfViewer_PdfViewerBase_AjaxRequestSettings), and it will be included in every AJAX request send from PDF Viewer.

The following code example shows how include the authorization token.

```cshtml
@using Syncfusion.Blazor.PdfViewer

<SfPdfViewer @ref="PdfViewer" ServiceUrl="https://ej2services.syncfusion.com/production/web-services/api/pdfviewer"  DocumentPath="@DocumentPath" AjaxRequestSettings="@AjaxRequestSettings" Height="500px" Width="1060px">
</SfPdfViewer>

@code{
SfPdfViewer PdfViewer;
private string DocumentPath { get; set; } = "PDF_Succinctly.pdf";

public PdfViewerAjaxRequestSettings AjaxRequestSettings = new PdfViewerAjaxRequestSettings{
    AjaxHeaders = new List<AjaxHeader>() {
        new AjaxHeader { 
            HeaderName = "Authorization", 
            HeaderValue = "Bearer 64565dfgfdsjweiuvbiuyhiueygf" 
        },

    }, 
    WithCredentials = false
};

}
```
