## Adding PDF Viewer events to Blazor component

The Syncfusion PDF Viewer events has to be wrapped inside the `PdfViewerEvents` tag.

```cshtml
<SfPdfViewerServer DocumentPath="@DocumentPath" Height="500px" Width="1060px" >
    <PdfViewerEvents DocumentLoaded="@DocumentLoaded"></PdfViewerEvents>
</SfPdfViewerServer>

@code{
    private string DocumentPath { get; set; } = "wwwroot/Data/PDF_Succinctly.pdf";
    private void DocumentLoaded(LoadEventArgs args)
    {
        object PageData = args.PageData;
    }
}
```

## Created event

The Created event is triggered when the PDFViewer component is rendered.

The following code illustrates how to load PDF document on created event.

```cshtml
@using Syncfusion.Blazor.PdfViewerServer
@using Syncfusion.Blazor.PdfViewer

<SfPdfViewerServer DocumentPath="@DocumentPath" Width="560" Height="315">
    <PdfViewerEvents Created="created"></PdfViewerEvents>
</SfPdfViewerServer>

@code 
{
    public string DocumentPath { get; set; }

    //Triggers when the PDFViewer component is created.
    public void created()
    {
        string Link = "http://infolab.stanford.edu/pub/papers/google.pdf";
        System.Net.WebClient webClient = new System.Net.WebClient();
        //Returns the byte array containing the downloaded PDF file.
        byte[] byteArray = webClient.DownloadData(Link);
        //Converting the byte array to Base64 string and sets the document path.
        DocumentPath = "data:application/pdf;base64," + Convert.ToBase64String(byteArray);
    }  
}
