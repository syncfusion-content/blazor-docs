# Globalization and RTL in Blazor PDF Viewer Component

## Localization

[Blazor PDFViewer](https://www.syncfusion.com/blazor-components/blazor-pdf-viewer) component can be localized. Refer to [Blazor Localization](https://blazor.syncfusion.com/documentation/common/localization) topic to localize Syncfusion Blazor components.

## Right to Left

Also, this component provides support to render the user interface suitable for users who use **right-to-left (RTL)** languages (Arabic, Hebrew, Azerbaijani, Persian, Urdu). You can specify the control to render in RTL by setting the `EnableRtl` property to true.

The following code snippet shows how to localize the component for Arabic language by setting the Locale and EnableRtl properties and providing the localized text.

```cshtml
@using Syncfusion.Blazor
@using Syncfusion.Blazor.PdfViewerServer


<SfPdfViewerServer Width="1060px" Height="500px" DocumentPath="@DocumentPath" EnableRtl="true" Locale="ar-AE" />

@code{
    public string DocumentPath { get; set; } = "wwwroot/data/PDF_Succinctly.pdf";
    [Inject]
    protected IJSRuntime JsRuntime { get; set; }
    protected override void OnAfterRender(bool firstRender)
    {
        this.JsRuntime.Sf().LoadLocaleData("wwwroot/locale.json");
    }
}
```
