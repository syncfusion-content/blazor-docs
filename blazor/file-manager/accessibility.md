# Accessibility in Blazor FileManager Component

The [Blazor FileManager](https://www.syncfusion.com/blazor-components/blazor-file-manager) component has been designed with keeping the [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/) specifications in mind, and applied the `WAI-ARIA` roles, states, and properties along with `keyboard support`. This component is characterized by complete keyboard interaction support and ARIA accessibility support, which makes navigation easy for people who use assistive technologies (AT) or for users who completely rely on keyboard navigation.

The Blazor FileManager component followed the accessibility guidelines and standards, including [ADA](https://www.ada.gov/), [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/), [WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) standards, and [WCAG roles](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#roles) that are commonly used to evaluate accessibility.

The accessibility compliance for the Blazor FileManager component is outlined below.
