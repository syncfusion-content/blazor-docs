The FileManager UI is comprised of several sections like View, Toolbar, Breadcrumb, Context Menu, and so on. The UI of the FileManager is enhanced with  `Details View` for browsing files and folders in a grid, `Navigation Pane` for folder navigation, and `Toolbar` for file operations. The FileManager with all features has the following sections in its UI.

* [Toolbar](#toolbar) (For direct access to file operations)
* [Context Menu](#context-menu) (For accessing file operations)
* [Navigation Pane](#navigation-pane) (For easy navigation between folders)
* [Breadcrumb](#breadcrumb) (For parent folder navigations)
* [Large icons view](#large-icons-view) (For browsing files and folders using large icon view)
* [Details view](#details-view) (For browsing files and folders using  details view)

## Toolbar

The `Toolbar` provides easy access to the file operations using different buttons and it is presented at the top of the FileManager.

If the Toolbar items exceed the size of the Toolbar, then the exceeding Toolbar size will be moved to Toolbar popup with a dropdown button at the end of Toolbar.

Refer [Toolbar](./file-operations.md#toolbar) section in file operations to know more about the buttons present in Toolbar.

## Context Menu

The Context Menu appears on user interaction such as right-click. The FileManager is provided with Context Menu support to perform list of file operations with the files and folders. Context menu appears with varying menu items based on the targets such as file, folder (including navigation pane folders), and layout (empty area in view).

Context menu can be customized using the [ContextMenuSettings](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.FileManager.FileManagerContextMenuSettings.html), [MenuOpened](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.FileManager.FileManagerEvents-1.html#Syncfusion_Blazor_FileManager_FileManagerEvents_1_MenuOpened), and [OnMenuClick](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.FileManager.FileManagerEvents-1.html#Syncfusion_Blazor_FileManager_FileManagerEvents_1_OnMenuClick) events.

Refer [Context Menu](./context-menu.md#context-menu-in-blazor-filemanager-component) section to know more about the menu items present in Context Menu.

## Files and Folders Navigation

The FileManager provides navigation between files and folders using the following two options.

* [Navigation Pane](#navigation-pane)
* [Breadcrumb](#breadcrumb)

## Navigation Pane

The navigation pane displays the folder hierarchy of the file system and provides easy navigation to the desired folder. Using [NavigationPaneSettings](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.FileManager.FileManagerNavigationPaneSettings.html), minimum and maximum width of the navigation pane can be changed. The navigation pane can be shown or hidden using the [Visible](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.FileManager.FileManagerNavigationPaneSettings.html#Syncfusion_Blazor_FileManager_FileManagerNavigationPaneSettings_Visible) option in the [NavigationPaneSettings](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.FileManager.FileManagerNavigationPaneSettings.html).

## BreadCrumb

The FileManager provides breadcrumb for navigating to the parent folders. The breadcrumb in the FileManager is responsible for resizing. Whenever the path length exceeds the breadcrumb length, a dropdown button will be added at the starting of the breadcrumb to hold the parent folders adjacent to root.

![Blazor FileManager with BreadCrumb](./images/blazor-filemanager-with-breadcrumb.png)

## Large Icons View

The `Large Icons View` is the default starting view in the FileManager. The view can be changed by using the [Toolbar](#toolbar) view button or by using the view menu in [Context Menu](#context-menu). The [View](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.FileManager.SfFileManager-1.html#Syncfusion_Blazor_FileManager_SfFileManager_1_View) API can also be used to change the initial view of the FileManager.

In the large icons view, the thumbnail icons will be shown in a larger size, which displays the data in a form that best suits their content. For image and video type files, a **preview** will be displayed. Extension thumbnails will be displayed for other type files.

![Blazor FileManager with LargeIconView](./images/blazor-filemanager-largeiconsview.png)

## Details View

In the details view, the files are displayed in a sorted list order. This file list comprises of several columns of information about the files such as **Name**, **Date Modified**, **Type**, and **Size**. Each file has its own small icon representing the file type. Additional columns can be added using [DetailsViewSettings](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.FileManager.FileManagerDetailsViewSettings.html) API. The details view allows you to perform sorting using column header.

## File Operations

The Blazor FileManager component is utilized for browsing, managing, and organizing files and folders in a file system through a web application. It offers all essential file operations, including creating new folders, uploading and downloading files, deleting and renaming existing files and folders, as well as previewing image files. 

Moreover, the table below displays the basic operations in the FileManager component and their corresponding functions.
