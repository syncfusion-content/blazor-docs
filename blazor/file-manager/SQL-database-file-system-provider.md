## SQL database file system provider

The SQL database file system provider allows the users to manage the file system being maintained in a SQL database table. Unlike the other file system providers, the SQL database file system provider works on ID basis. Here, each file and folder have a unique ID based on which all the file operations will be performed. To get started, clone the [EJ2.ASP.NET Core SQL Server Database File Provider](https://github.com/SyncfusionExamples/ej2-sql-server-database-aspcore-file-provider) using the following command.

```json

<add name="FileExplorerConnection" connectionString="Data Source=(LocalDB)\v11.0;AttachDbFilename=|DataDirectory|\FileManager.mdf;Integrated Security=True;Trusted_Connection=true" />

```

After cloning, just open the project in Visual Studio and restore the NuGet packages. To establish the SQL server connection with the database file (for eg: FileManager.mdf), you need to specify the connection string in the web config file as shown below.

```json

<add name="FileExplorerConnection" connectionString="Data Source=(LocalDB)\v11.0;AttachDbFilename=|DataDirectory|\FileManager.mdf;Integrated Security=True;Trusted_Connection=true" />

```

Then, make an entry for the connection string in `appsettings.json` file as shown below.

```json

"ConnectionStrings": {
    "FileManagerConnection": "Data Source=(LocalDB)\\MSSQLLocalDB;AttachDbFilename=|DataDirectory|\\App_Data\\FileManager.mdf;Integrated Security=True;Connect Timeout=30"
  }

```

Now, to configure the database connection, you need to set the connection name, table name and root folder ID value by passing these values to the SetSQLConnection method.

```csharp

void SetSQLConnection(string name, string tableName, string tableID)\

```

N> Refer to this [FileManager.mdf](https://github.com/SyncfusionExamples/ej2-sql-server-database-aspcore-file-provider/blob/master/App_Data/FileManager.mdf) to learn about the pre-defined file system SQL database for the Blazor File Manager.

After configuring the connection, just build and run the project. Now, the project will be hosted in `http://localhost:{port}` and just mapping the ajaxSettings property of the FileManager component to the appropriate controller methods allows to manage the files in the SQL database table.

```cshtml

@*Initializing File Manager with SQL database file system service*@

@* Replace the hosted port number in the place of "{port}" *@

<SfFileManager TValue="FileManagerDirectoryContent">
    <FileManagerAjaxSettings Url="http://localhost:{port}/api/SQLProvider/SQLFileOperations"
                             UploadUrl="http://localhost:{port}/api/SQLProvider/SQLUpload"
                             DownloadUrl="http://localhost:{port}/api/SQLProvider/SQLDownload"
                             GetImageUrl="http://localhost:{port}/api/SQLProvider/SQLGetImage">
    </FileManagerAjaxSettings>
</SfFileManager>
